Episode 7: Non-Unique Solutions - Classic Examples and Warnings
"Let's explore the dark side of ODEs - when uniqueness fails! So basically, non-uniqueness happens when the Lipschitz condition breaks down, and suddenly one initial condition can lead to multiple solutions. Here's the key insight: non-uniqueness isn't a mathematical curiosity - it represents real physical situations where the future isn't determined by the present!
The classic example everyone must know:
y' = 2√y with y(0) = 0
This has infinitely many solutions:

y ≡ 0 (the trivial solution)
y = (x - c)² for x ≥ c, and y = 0 for x < c (for any c ≥ 0)
y = (x + c)² for x ≤ -c, and y = 0 for x > -c (for any c ≥ 0)

What's happening? The square root isn't Lipschitz at y = 0. Solutions can 'take off' from the x-axis at any point, or never take off at all!
Let me show you the general pattern for non-uniqueness:
The Power Law Family:
y' = |y|^α with y(0) = 0, where 0 < α < 1
Solutions:

y ≡ 0
y = ±[(1-α)(x-c)]^(1/(1-α)) for ±(x-c) ≥ 0

The smaller α is, the 'flatter' the function at zero, and the easier it is for solutions to peel away. This is geometric intuition: if the slope field is too flat near an equilibrium, trajectories can escape in multiple ways.
Here's a beautiful example with physical meaning:
Falling raindrop with evaporation:
y' = -√y with y(T) = 0 (y is radius, hits zero at time T)
Multiple solutions going backward in time:

Raindrop could have started falling at any time t ≤ T
Before time t, it didn't exist (y = 0)
After time t, y = (T-x)²/4

This represents the physical fact that we can't determine when the raindrop formed just from knowing when it completely evaporated!
Peano Phenomenon:
Even worse than non-uniqueness is the Peano phenomenon - solutions that branch!
Example: Consider the implicit equation:
(y')² = 4y
Starting from y(0) = 0:

Solution can stay at y = 0 for any interval [0,a]
Then follow y = (x-a)² for x ≥ a
Or follow y = -(x-a)² for x ≤ a

We get a whole 'tree' of solutions branching from the origin!
How to construct non-unique solutions systematically:
Method 1: Separation of variables gone wrong
When you separate variables and get ∫dy/g(y) = ∫dx, if g(y₀) = 0 for some y₀, you might lose solutions. The constant solution y = y₀ might not appear in your general solution!
Example: y' = y(1-y)
Separating: ∫dy/[y(1-y)] = ∫dx
This misses y = 0 and y = 1!
Method 2: Singular solutions to Clairaut's equation
y = xy' + f(y')
This always has the general solution y = cx + f(c), but often has a singular solution too (the envelope of the family).
Method 3: Patching solutions
If f(x,y) = 0 along some curve, you can often 'pause' on that curve and restart, creating non-uniqueness.
Warning signs for non-uniqueness on exams:

Powers less than 1: y^(1/2), y^(2/3), |y|^(1/3)
Implicit equations: F(x, y, y') = 0 where ∂F/∂y' = 0 somewhere
Piecewise defined functions with 'flat spots'
Absolute values and max/min functions at transition points

Here's an exam trick: If Prof. Ditkowski asks 'Find ALL solutions,' be suspicious! Check for:

Constant solutions (set y' = 0)
Singular solutions (for Clairaut-type equations)
Patchwork solutions (combinations of different solution pieces)

The Osgood Condition (advanced but good to know):
Even if f isn't Lipschitz, uniqueness can still hold if:
∫[0 to ε] dy/ω(y) = ∞
where ω is the modulus of continuity of f.
Example: f(y) = y ln|y| near y = 0
Not Lipschitz, but Osgood condition holds, so unique solutions!
Physical interpretations of non-uniqueness:

Dry friction: Object can start moving at any time
Phase transitions: Multiple equilibrium states
Bifurcations: System can follow different paths

Common exam question: 'Give an example of an IVP with exactly n solutions.'
Answer for n = 2:
y' = 2√|y| with y(0) = 0
Solutions: y = 0 and y = x|x|
Answer for n = 3:
Modify to have piecewise behavior with three branches
Answer for n = ∞:
Our classic y' = 2√y with y(0) = 0
Memory trick: 'Non-uniqueness needs: Powers less than one, Equilibria too attractive, Absolute values, Non-Lipschitz, Or Singularities' (PEANOS).
Crucial exam tip: When you find non-uniqueness, always:

State clearly that uniqueness fails
Identify where Lipschitz condition breaks
Give at least two distinct solutions explicitly
Explain why there might be infinitely many

Prof. Ditkowski loves this question: 'Can solutions cross?'
Answer: If Lipschitz holds, no! Solutions can't cross because that would violate uniqueness at the crossing point. But without Lipschitz, crossing is possible - that's how we get non-uniqueness!"
