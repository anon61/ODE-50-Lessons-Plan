Episode 25: Orthogonal Trajectories and Applications**

Audio Lesson Script**

*[Opening with physical motivation]*

Picture this: you're looking at the electric field lines radiating out from a positive charge. Now imagine the equipotential curves - those circles centered on the charge where the voltage is constant. Notice something beautiful? They meet at right angles! This isn't coincidence - it's a fundamental principle that appears everywhere in physics and engineering. Today, we're learning how to find these orthogonal trajectories, and trust me, Prof. Ditkowski LOVES this topic because it connects differential equations to real-world applications.

So basically, orthogonal trajectories are curves that intersect a given family of curves at right angles. Here's the key insight: if you have a family of curves described by F(x,y,c) = 0, where c is a parameter, you can find the family of curves perpendicular to them using a beautiful trick with differential equations.

Let me show you the systematic approach. Step one: eliminate the parameter c by differentiation. If your family is y = cx², differentiate to get dy/dx = 2cx. Now substitute back to eliminate c: since c = y/x², we get dy/dx = 2y/x. This differential equation describes the original family!

Step two - and this is the magic - to find orthogonal trajectories, replace dy/dx with -dx/dy. Why? Because if two curves are perpendicular, their slopes are negative reciprocals! So our orthogonal equation becomes -dx/dy = 2y/x, or dx/dy = -2y/x.

Step three: solve this new equation. Rearranging: x dx = -2y dy. Integrating both sides: x²/2 = -y² + C, or x² + 2y² = K. These ellipses are orthogonal to the original parabolas y = cx²!

Let's work through another classic example that shows up on every exam. Find the orthogonal trajectories of the family of circles x² + y² = c².

First, differentiate implicitly: 2x + 2y(dy/dx) = 0, so dy/dx = -x/y. This is the differential equation for the circles.

For orthogonal trajectories: replace dy/dx with -dx/dy to get -dx/dy = -x/y, or dx/dy = x/y.

Solving: y dy = x dx, integrating gives y²/2 = x²/2 + C, or y² - x² = K. These are rectangular hyperbolas - perpendicular to circles!

Here's a common mistake students make: they forget to eliminate the parameter BEFORE finding the differential equation. If you don't eliminate c first, you'll get the wrong equation and everything falls apart. Prof. Ditkowski deducts major points for this!

The physical applications are everywhere! In electrostatics, field lines and equipotentials are orthogonal. In fluid dynamics, streamlines and velocity potential curves are perpendicular. In heat transfer, heat flow lines and isotherms meet at right angles. This isn't just math - it's how nature organizes itself!

Let me give you a more complex example that combines everything we've learned. Find orthogonal trajectories of y = ce^x.

Differentiate: dy/dx = ce^x. But wait - we need to eliminate c! From the original equation, c = ye^(-x), so dy/dx = ye^(-x) · e^x = y. The differential equation is simply dy/dx = y.

For orthogonal trajectories: -dx/dy = y, or dx/dy = -y. This is tricky - we need x as a function of y. Rearranging: dx = -y dy, so x = -y²/2 + C. The orthogonal trajectories are parabolas opening sideways!

Prof. Ditkowski's favorite trick question: "Find self-orthogonal families." These are families where the orthogonal trajectories belong to the same family! Example: the family of rectangular hyperbolas xy = c. The differential equation is dy/dx = -y/x. The orthogonal equation is -dx/dy = -y/x, or dx/dy = y/x, which gives xy = K - the same family! Mind-blowing, right?

Here's a memory device: "Orthogonal means flip and negate" - flip dy/dx to dx/dy and negate it. Some students remember it as "perpendicular slopes multiply to -1," which leads to the same transformation.

For polar coordinates, there's a different rule! If the family has differential equation dr/dθ = f(r,θ), the orthogonal trajectories satisfy r²(dθ/dr) = f(r,θ). The r² factor comes from the geometry of polar coordinates.

Warning for the exam: Prof. Ditkowski often asks you to sketch both families. Remember - they should visibly intersect at right angles! Use this as a check: if your sketches don't look perpendicular, something's wrong with your calculation.

The connection to complex analysis is beautiful. In the complex plane, if u(x,y) = c₁ and v(x,y) = c₂ are orthogonal families, then f(z) = u + iv is analytic! This is why orthogonal trajectories appear in conformal mapping and potential theory.

Common exam pattern: given a physical situation (like temperature distribution), derive the differential equation, find orthogonal trajectories, and interpret physically. For temperature T = c, orthogonal trajectories are heat flow lines!

So basically, orthogonal trajectories let us find perpendicular curve families systematically. Eliminate the parameter, get the differential equation, flip and negate dy/dx, solve the new equation, and interpret the result. Master this process, and you'll ace these problems that beautifully connect math to physics!
