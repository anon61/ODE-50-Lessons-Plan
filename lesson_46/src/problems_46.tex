\item For the equation $x^2y'' + x(1-x)y' - (1+3x)y = 0$, find the indicial equation at $x = 0$.

% Frobenius Series Solutions
\item Use the Frobenius method to find the general solution of $2xy'' + (1-2x)y' - y = 0$ near $x = 0$.

\item If the indicial equation has roots $r_1 = 2$ and $r_2 = -1$, what form will the two solutions take?

\item Explain why a logarithmic term appears when the indicial equation has a repeated root.

% Modified Bessel Equation
\item Show that the modified Bessel equation $x^2y'' + xy' - (x^2 + n^2)y = 0$ has $x = 0$ as a regular singular point.

\item Find the indicial equation for the modified Bessel equation of order zero: $x^2y'' + xy' - x^2y = 0$.

\item Determine the form of solutions for $x^2y'' + xy' - (x^2 + 1)y = 0$ near $x = 0$.

% Euler Equations

\item Compare the Frobenius method solution with the standard Euler equation solution for $x^2y'' - xy' + y = 0$.

% Convergence and Radius
\item For the equation $xy'' + (1-x^2)y' - xy = 0$, determine the radius of convergence of the series solution about $x = 0$.

\item If $x = 0$ and $x = 1$ are the only singular points of an ODE, what is the minimum radius of convergence for a series solution about $x = 1/2$?

\item Explain why the series solution of $(1-x^2)y'' - 2xy' + n(n+1)y = 0$ (Legendre equation) converges for $|x| < 1$.

% Application Problems
\item The radial part of the SchrÃ¶dinger equation for the hydrogen atom leads to $r^2R'' + 2rR' + [r^2 - l(l+1)]R = 0$. Classify the singular point at $r = 0$.

% Advanced Problems
\item If the indicial equation has roots differing by an integer, explain when the second solution will require a logarithmic term.

\item For $x^2y'' + x(1+x)y' + (x-n^2)y = 0$, find conditions on $n$ for which both Frobenius solutions are valid without logarithmic terms.

\item Prove that if $r_1 - r_2 = N$ (positive integer) and the coefficient of $a_N$ in the recurrence relation for the second solution is zero, then a logarithmic term is necessary.

\item Given that one solution of $x^2y'' + xy' + (x^2-1)y = 0$ is $y_1 = x^{-1}\sin x$, use reduction of order to find the second solution and compare with the Frobenius method result.
