\LESSON 10: Qualitative Behavior Without Solving
Audio Lesson Script
[Conversational, 950 words]
Alright, so basically we're taking things to the next level today! You know how in Lesson 9 we learned to visualize ODEs with direction fields? Well, here's the key insight - we can predict EVERYTHING about solutions without ever finding a formula! This is pure mathematical detective work, and Prof. Ditkowski absolutely loves testing this.
Let me show you the most powerful tool first - phase line analysis. This works for autonomous first-order equations, meaning dy/dx = f(y) where there's no explicit x dependence. Picture this: instead of the whole xy-plane, we just look at the y-axis. We mark equilibria where f(y) = 0, then between equilibria, we check if f(y) is positive or negative. Positive means y increases, so we draw an arrow pointing up. Negative means y decreases, arrow points down.
Here's a concrete example that shows up constantly: dy/dx = y(1-y). The equilibria are y = 0 and y = 1. Let's check signs: for y < 0, we have (negative)(positive) = negative, arrow down. For 0 < y < 1, we have (positive)(positive) = positive, arrow up. For y > 1, we have (positive)(negative) = negative, arrow down.
Now here's where students mess up - they forget to check stability! Look at the arrows AROUND each equilibrium. At y = 0, arrows point away (down below, up above) - that's unstable! At y = 1, arrows point toward it from both sides - that's stable! Memory trick: "Stable equilibria are arrow SINKS, unstable are arrow SOURCES."
Let me teach you the derivative test for stability - this is HUGE for exams. If dy/dx = f(y) and y* is an equilibrium, then compute f'(y*). If f'(y*) < 0, it's stable. If f'(y*) > 0, it's unstable. For our example, f(y) = y(1-y) = y - y², so f'(y) = 1 - 2y. At y = 0: f'(0) = 1 > 0, unstable! At y = 1: f'(1) = -1 < 0, stable! See how much faster that was?
Now let's talk comparison theorems - these are Prof. Ditkowski gold! Say you have two solutions y₁ and y₂ to the same ODE, with y₁(x₀) < y₂(x₀). If f(y) is continuous and satisfies uniqueness conditions, then y₁(x) < y₂(x) for ALL x! Solutions can't cross! This means if you know one solution, you can bound others.
Here's a killer application: suppose dy/dx = -y³ and you know y(0) = 2. Without solving, what happens as x → ∞? Well, y = 0 is an equilibrium. Since -y³ < 0 when y > 0, the solution decreases. By comparison, it stays above y = 0 (can't cross!). So y(x) decreases toward 0. Boom - asymptotic behavior without formulas!
Let's discuss monotonicity and concavity. For dy/dx = f(x,y), check the sign of dy/dx for monotonicity. For concavity, compute d²y/dx² using the chain rule: d²y/dx² = ∂f/∂x + (∂f/∂y)f. Where this is positive, solutions curve up. Where negative, they curve down.
Example time! Consider dy/dx = x - y². At point (1,1), we have dy/dx = 1 - 1 = 0, so the solution has a horizontal tangent there. For the second derivative: d²y/dx² = 1 - 2y(x - y²). At (1,1): d²y/dx² = 1 - 2(1)(0) = 1 > 0. The solution has a local minimum there!
Here's something students always struggle with - energy methods. For certain ODEs, you can find a conserved quantity E(x,y) where dE/dx = 0 along solutions. This is called a first integral. Classic example: dy/dx = -x/y. Multiply both sides by y: y dy = -x dx. Integrate: y²/2 = -x²/2 + C. So x² + y² = constant - solutions are circles!
Pro tip for recognizing conservative systems: if dy/dx = f(x,y) can be written as dy/dx = -∂H/∂x ÷ ∂H/∂y for some function H(x,y), then H is conserved! The level curves of H are solution curves.
For periodic solutions, here's the test: you need a closed trajectory in the phase plane. For autonomous equations dy/dx = f(y), this is impossible (phase line is one-dimensional). But for systems or non-autonomous equations, look for energy conservation or use the Poincaré-Bendixson theorem.
Common exam pattern from Prof. Ditkowski: "Given dy/dx = [some expression], determine all possible long-term behaviors." Your approach: find equilibria, analyze stability, check for periodic solutions, look for invariant regions, apply comparison theorems. Never just guess - use these systematic tools!
The absolute key takeaway? Qualitative analysis isn't just "hand-waving" - it's rigorous mathematics that reveals deep structure. You can prove solutions exist, determine their behavior, find bounds, all without formulas. Master these techniques and you'll see ODEs in a completely new light. Plus, you'll nail those 40% of exam questions that test this stuff!

\section{Phase Line Analysis}

\begin{definition}[Phase Line]
For an autonomous ODE $\frac{dy}{dx} = f(y)$, the \textbf{phase line} is a one-dimensional representation showing equilibria and flow direction along the $y$-axis.
\end{definition}

\begin{method}[Constructing Phase Lines]
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Find equilibria: solve $f(y) = 0$
    \item Determine sign of $f(y)$ between equilibria
    \item Draw arrows: up if $f(y) > 0$, down if $f(y) < 0$
    \item Classify stability based on arrow directions
\end{enumerate}
\end{method}

\section{Stability Analysis}

\begin{theorem}[Linear Stability Test]
For $\frac{dy}{dx} = f(y)$ with equilibrium $y^*$:
\begin{itemize}
    \item If $f'(y^*) < 0$: asymptotically stable
    \item If $f'(y^*) > 0$: unstable
    \item If $f'(y^*) = 0$: test inconclusive (need higher derivatives)
\end{itemize}
\end{theorem}

\begin{example}[Logistic Equation]
For $\frac{dy}{dx} = ry(1 - y/K)$ with $r, K > 0$:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Equilibria: $y = 0$ and $y = K$
    \item $f'(y) = r(1 - 2y/K)$
    \item At $y = 0$: $f'(0) = r > 0$ (unstable)
    \item At $y = K$: $f'(K) = -r < 0$ (stable)
\end{itemize}
\end{example}

\section{Comparison Theorems}

\begin{theorem}[Basic Comparison Principle]
If $y_1(x)$ and $y_2(x)$ are solutions to $\frac{dy}{dx} = f(x,y)$ where $f$ satisfies uniqueness conditions, and $y_1(x_0) < y_2(x_0)$, then $y_1(x) < y_2(x)$ for all $x$ in the interval of existence.
\end{theorem}

\begin{keypoint}
Solutions cannot cross! This provides powerful bounds on solution behavior.
\end{keypoint}

\section{Monotonicity and Concavity}

\begin{method}[Analyzing Solution Shape]
For $\frac{dy}{dx} = f(x,y)$:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Monotonicity}: Sign of $f(x,y)$ determines if $y$ increases or decreases
    \item \textbf{Concavity}: Compute $\frac{d^2y}{dx^2} = \frac{\partial f}{\partial x} + \frac{\partial f}{\partial y} \cdot f$
    \item Positive second derivative $\Rightarrow$ concave up
    \item Negative second derivative $\Rightarrow$ concave down
\end{enumerate}
\end{method}

\section{Energy Methods and First Integrals}

\begin{definition}[First Integral]
A function $H(x,y)$ is a \textbf{first integral} of $\frac{dy}{dx} = f(x,y)$ if $H$ is constant along solution curves.
\end{definition}

\begin{theorem}[Exactness Criterion]
The ODE $M(x,y)dx + N(x,y)dy = 0$ is exact if $\frac{\partial M}{\partial y} = \frac{\partial N}{\partial x}$. When exact, solutions are level curves of $H(x,y)$ where $\frac{\partial H}{\partial x} = M$ and $\frac{\partial H}{\partial y} = N$.
\end{theorem}

\begin{insight}
Energy methods reveal hidden conservation laws and geometric structure!
\end{insight}

\section{Asymptotic Behavior}

\begin{method}[Determining Long-term Behavior]
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Identify all equilibria
    \item Analyze stability of each equilibrium
    \item Look for invariant regions (where solutions cannot escape)
    \item Apply comparison theorems for bounds
    \item Check for periodic orbits (closed trajectories)
\end{enumerate}
\end{method}

\section{Periodic Solutions}

\begin{theorem}[Conditions for Periodicity]
\begin{itemize}
    \item Autonomous 1D equations cannot have periodic solutions
    \item For 2D systems, look for:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Centers in linear analysis
        \item Conserved quantities (Hamiltonian systems)
        \item Application of Poincaré-Bendixson theorem
    \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
\end{theorem}

\section{Exam Strategy}

\begin{warning}
Prof. Ditkowski's favorite qualitative analysis questions:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Sketch phase line and determine all asymptotic behaviors
    \item Prove solution boundedness without solving
    \item Use comparison to relate unknown solutions to known ones
    \item Find conserved quantities for given ODEs
    \item Determine existence/non-existence of periodic solutions
\end{enumerate}
\end{warning}
