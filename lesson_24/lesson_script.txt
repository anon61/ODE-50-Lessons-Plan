Episode 24: Special Integrating Factors - μ(xy) and Beyond**

Audio Lesson Script**

*[Opening with intrigue]*

So you've tested for μ(x) - nope, both variables appear. You've tested for μ(y) - still no luck. Is it game over? Absolutely not! Here's the key insight that separates the pros from the amateurs: there's a whole world of special integrating factors beyond μ(x) and μ(y), and Prof. Ditkowski loves testing these because they require real understanding, not just mechanical computation.

Let me show you the star of today's show: μ(xy). This beauty appears when the integrating factor depends on the product xy. The test is more complex but follows the same logic. We need (∂M/∂y - ∂N/∂x)/(xN - yM) to be a function of xy only. If it is, we've struck gold!

So basically, here's how it works. Let z = xy, so μ = μ(z). Using the chain rule, ∂μ/∂x = μ'(z) · y and ∂μ/∂y = μ'(z) · x. Substituting into our exactness condition and doing some algebra (trust me, it's messy but worth it), we get that magical test formula.

Let's work through a classic example: (y² - xy)dx + (x² - xy)dy = 0. First, check exactness: ∂M/∂y = 2y - x and ∂N/∂x = 2x - y. Not equal - not exact!

Check μ(x): (My - Nx)/N = (2y - x - 2x + y)/(x² - xy) = (3y - 3x)/(x² - xy). This has both x and y - no good.

Check μ(y): (Nx - My)/M = (2x - y - 2y + x)/(y² - xy) = (3x - 3y)/(y² - xy). Again, both variables - no luck.

Now for μ(xy): (My - Nx)/(xN - yM) = (3y - 3x)/(x(x² - xy) - y(y² - xy)) = (3y - 3x)/(x³ - x²y - y³ + xy²) = (3y - 3x)/(x³ - y³ - xy(x - y)) = -3(x - y)/((x - y)(x² + xy + y²) - xy(x - y)) = -3/(x² + 2xy + y²) = -3/(x + y)².

Hmm, this isn't a function of xy either! But wait - notice something interesting? Let me try a different approach. What if μ = 1/(xy)? Let's check: multiply the original equation by 1/(xy): (y/x - 1)dx + (x/y - 1)dy = 0.

Rewriting: (y/x)dx + (x/y)dy - dx - dy = 0. Testing exactness of the first part: ∂(y/x)/∂y = 1/x and ∂(x/y)/∂x = 1/y. Not exact yet...

Actually, let me show you a better example for μ(xy): (2xy² + y)dx + (2x²y + x)dy = 0. Here, (My - Nx)/(xN - yM) = (4xy + 1 - 4xy - 1)/(x(2x²y + x) - y(2xy² + y)) = 0/(2x³y + x² - 2xy³ - y²). Well, that's interesting - we get 0, which is certainly a function of xy!

This means μ(xy) = e^0 = 1, so the equation is already exact? Let's verify: ∂M/∂y = 4xy + 1, ∂N/∂x = 4xy + 1. Yes! Sometimes the test reveals hidden exactness!

Here's a genuine μ(xy) example that Prof. Ditkowski uses: (y + xy²)dx + (x - x²y)dy = 0. Working through the test: (My - Nx)/(xN - yM) = (1 + 2xy - 1 + 2xy)/(x(x - x²y) - y(y + xy²)) = 4xy/(x² - x³y - y² - xy³) = 4xy/(x² - y² - xy(x²+y²)).

This is tricky, but with some factoring... actually, let me try μ = 1/xy directly. Multiplying: (1/x + y)dx + (1/y - x)dy = 0. Check exactness: ∂(1/x + y)/∂y = 1 and ∂(1/y - x)/∂x = -1. Not exact with this form either.

The real power move? Sometimes you need μ(x² + y²) for equations with circular symmetry! The test is (My - Nx)/(xM + yN) should be a function of x² + y² only. This appears in problems involving radial distance.

Example: (x² + y² + y)dx + (x² + y² - x)dy = 0. Here's the trick - recognize that x² + y² appears throughout. Let r² = x² + y², and often μ = 1/r² or μ = r^n works!

Prof. Ditkowski's favorite trick question: "Find an integrating factor of the form μ = x^a y^b." This requires setting up the exactness condition and comparing powers of x and y on both sides - it's like solving a system for a and b!

For homogeneous equations (where M and N are homogeneous of the same degree), there's a beautiful theorem: μ = 1/(xM + yN) is always an integrating factor! This is pure magic when you recognize homogeneity.

Memory device for the special tests: "My Nexus over X times N minus Y times M" for μ(xy). The denominator has that cross pattern: xN - yM. For μ(x² + y²), think "My Nexus over X·M plus Y·N" - now it's a plus sign and we multiply by the same letters!

Common mistake: Students try these special forms randomly without systematic testing. Always check μ(x) and μ(y) first - they're simpler! Only move to special forms when both basic tests fail.

The physical interpretation is beautiful - μ(xy) often appears in problems with hyperbolic symmetry, while μ(x² + y²) shows up in problems with circular symmetry. It's like the equation is telling you what coordinate system it prefers!

So basically, when μ(x) and μ(y) fail, don't panic. Test for μ(xy) using the cross-product denominator formula. If that fails, look for symmetries - circular suggests μ(r²), homogeneous suggests μ = 1/(xM + yN). Master these special forms, and you'll handle any integrating factor problem on the exam!
