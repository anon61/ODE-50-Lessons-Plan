# **Lesson 24: Special Integrating Factors - μ(xy) and Beyond**

## **Part 1: Audio Lesson Script**

*[Opening with intrigue]*

So you've tested for μ(x) - nope, both variables appear. You've tested for μ(y) - still no luck. Is it game over? Absolutely not! Here's the key insight that separates the pros from the amateurs: there's a whole world of special integrating factors beyond μ(x) and μ(y), and Prof. Ditkowski loves testing these because they require real understanding, not just mechanical computation.

Let me show you the star of today's show: μ(xy). This beauty appears when the integrating factor depends on the product xy. The test is more complex but follows the same logic. We need (∂M/∂y - ∂N/∂x)/(xN - yM) to be a function of xy only. If it is, we've struck gold!

So basically, here's how it works. Let z = xy, so μ = μ(z). Using the chain rule, ∂μ/∂x = μ'(z) · y and ∂μ/∂y = μ'(z) · x. Substituting into our exactness condition and doing some algebra (trust me, it's messy but worth it), we get that magical test formula.

Let's work through a classic example: (y² - xy)dx + (x² - xy)dy = 0. First, check exactness: ∂M/∂y = 2y - x and ∂N/∂x = 2x - y. Not equal - not exact!

Check μ(x): (My - Nx)/N = (2y - x - 2x + y)/(x² - xy) = (3y - 3x)/(x² - xy). This has both x and y - no good.

Check μ(y): (Nx - My)/M = (2x - y - 2y + x)/(y² - xy) = (3x - 3y)/(y² - xy). Again, both variables - no luck.

Now for μ(xy): (My - Nx)/(xN - yM) = (3y - 3x)/(x(x² - xy) - y(y² - xy)) = (3y - 3x)/(x³ - x²y - y³ + xy²) = (3y - 3x)/(x³ - y³ - xy(x - y)) = -3(x - y)/((x - y)(x² + xy + y²) - xy(x - y)) = -3/(x² + 2xy + y²) = -3/(x + y)².

Hmm, this isn't a function of xy either! But wait - notice something interesting? Let me try a different approach. What if μ = 1/(xy)? Let's check: multiply the original equation by 1/(xy): (y/x - 1)dx + (x/y - 1)dy = 0.

Rewriting: (y/x)dx + (x/y)dy - dx - dy = 0. Testing exactness of the first part: ∂(y/x)/∂y = 1/x and ∂(x/y)/∂x = 1/y. Not exact yet...

Actually, let me show you a better example for μ(xy): (2xy² + y)dx + (2x²y + x)dy = 0. Here, (My - Nx)/(xN - yM) = (4xy + 1 - 4xy - 1)/(x(2x²y + x) - y(2xy² + y)) = 0/(2x³y + x² - 2xy³ - y²). Well, that's interesting - we get 0, which is certainly a function of xy!

This means μ(xy) = e^0 = 1, so the equation is already exact? Let's verify: ∂M/∂y = 4xy + 1, ∂N/∂x = 4xy + 1. Yes! Sometimes the test reveals hidden exactness!

Here's a genuine μ(xy) example that Prof. Ditkowski uses: (y + xy²)dx + (x - x²y)dy = 0. Working through the test: (My - Nx)/(xN - yM) = (1 + 2xy - 1 + 2xy)/(x(x - x²y) - y(y + xy²)) = 4xy/(x² - x³y - y² - xy³) = 4xy/(x² - y² - xy(x²+y²)).

This is tricky, but with some factoring... actually, let me try μ = 1/xy directly. Multiplying: (1/x + y)dx + (1/y - x)dy = 0. Check exactness: ∂(1/x + y)/∂y = 1 and ∂(1/y - x)/∂x = -1. Not exact with this form either.

The real power move? Sometimes you need μ(x² + y²) for equations with circular symmetry! The test is (My - Nx)/(xM + yN) should be a function of x² + y² only. This appears in problems involving radial distance.

Example: (x² + y² + y)dx + (x² + y² - x)dy = 0. Here's the trick - recognize that x² + y² appears throughout. Let r² = x² + y², and often μ = 1/r² or μ = r^n works!

Prof. Ditkowski's favorite trick question: "Find an integrating factor of the form μ = x^a y^b." This requires setting up the exactness condition and comparing powers of x and y on both sides - it's like solving a system for a and b!

For homogeneous equations (where M and N are homogeneous of the same degree), there's a beautiful theorem: μ = 1/(xM + yN) is always an integrating factor! This is pure magic when you recognize homogeneity.

Memory device for the special tests: "My Nexus over X times N minus Y times M" for μ(xy). The denominator has that cross pattern: xN - yM. For μ(x² + y²), think "My Nexus over X·M plus Y·N" - now it's a plus sign and we multiply by the same letters!

Common mistake: Students try these special forms randomly without systematic testing. Always check μ(x) and μ(y) first - they're simpler! Only move to special forms when both basic tests fail.

The physical interpretation is beautiful - μ(xy) often appears in problems with hyperbolic symmetry, while μ(x² + y²) shows up in problems with circular symmetry. It's like the equation is telling you what coordinate system it prefers!

So basically, when μ(x) and μ(y) fail, don't panic. Test for μ(xy) using the cross-product denominator formula. If that fails, look for symmetries - circular suggests μ(r²), homogeneous suggests μ = 1/(xM + yN). Master these special forms, and you'll handle any integrating factor problem on the exam!

\section{Beyond Simple Integrating Factors}

When neither $\mu(x)$ nor $\mu(y)$ exists, we look for integrating factors of special forms:
\begin{itemize}
    \item $\mu(xy)$ - depends on the product $xy$
    \item $\mu(x^2 + y^2)$ - depends on radial distance
    \item $\mu = x^a y^b$ - power form
    \item $\mu = 1/(xM + yN)$ - for homogeneous equations
\end{itemize}

\begin{keypoint}
Each special form has its own existence test. Master the tests to quickly identify which form to use!
\end{keypoint}

\section{Case 3: Integrating Factor $\mu(xy)$}

\begin{theorem}[Existence of $\mu(xy)$]
An integrating factor depending only on $z = xy$ exists if and only if
\[\frac{1}{xN - yM}\left(\frac{\partial M}{\partial y} - \frac{\partial N}{\partial x}\right) = F(xy)\]
where $F$ is a function of $xy$ alone. The integrating factor is:
\[\mu(xy) = e^{\int F(z)\,dz} \text{ where } z = xy\]
\end{theorem}

\begin{proof}[Proof Sketch]
If $\mu = \mu(z)$ where $z = xy$, then:
\[\frac{\partial \mu}{\partial x} = \frac{d\mu}{dz} \cdot y, \quad \frac{\partial \mu}{\partial y} = \frac{d\mu}{dz} \cdot x\]

Substituting into the exactness condition:
\[M \cdot \frac{d\mu}{dz} \cdot x - N \cdot \frac{d\mu}{dz} \cdot y = \mu(N_x - M_y)\]
\[\frac{1}{\mu}\frac{d\mu}{dz} = \frac{M_y - N_x}{xN - yM}\]

This requires the right side to be a function of $z = xy$ only.
\end{proof}

\begin{algorithm}
\textbf{Testing for $\mu(xy)$:}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Compute $M_y - N_x$ (numerator)
    \item Compute $xN - yM$ (denominator - note the pattern!)
    \item Form the ratio $\frac{M_y - N_x}{xN - yM}$
    \item Check if this can be expressed as $F(xy)$
    \item If yes, solve $\frac{d\mu}{dz} = \mu \cdot F(z)$ where $z = xy$
\end{enumerate}
\end{algorithm}

\begin{example}[$\mu(xy)$ Application]
Solve $(2y^2 + 3xy)dx + (2xy + x^2)dy = 0$

\textbf{Step 1:} Check exactness: $M_y = 4y + 3x$, $N_x = 2y + 2x$. Not exact.

\textbf{Step 2:} Test $\mu(x)$: $\frac{M_y - N_x}{N} = \frac{2y + x}{2xy + x^2} = \frac{2y + x}{x(2y + x)} = \frac{1}{x}$

Actually, $\mu(x) = x$ works here! But let's continue for illustration...

\textbf{Step 3:} Test $\mu(xy)$:
\[\frac{M_y - N_x}{xN - yM} = \frac{2y + x}{x(2xy + x^2) - y(2y^2 + 3xy)}\]
\[= \frac{2y + x}{2x^2y + x^3 - 2y^3 - 3xy^2}\]

This expression is complex and not a clear function of $xy$.
\end{example}

\section{Case 4: Integrating Factor $\mu(x^2 + y^2)$}

\begin{theorem}[Existence of $\mu(x^2 + y^2)$]
An integrating factor depending only on $r^2 = x^2 + y^2$ exists if and only if
\[\frac{1}{xM + yN}\left(\frac{\partial M}{\partial y} - \frac{\partial N}{\partial x}\right) = G(x^2 + y^2)\]
where $G$ is a function of $x^2 + y^2$ alone.
\end{theorem}

\begin{insight}
The denominator $xM + yN$ appears naturally in polar coordinate transformations. This test often succeeds for equations with circular symmetry.
\end{insight}

\begin{example}[Radial Integrating Factor]
Consider $(x^2 + y^2 + x)dx + (x^2 + y^2 + y)dy = 0$

Let's test for $\mu(x^2 + y^2)$:
\[M_y - N_x = 2y - 2x\]
\[xM + yN = x(x^2 + y^2 + x) + y(x^2 + y^2 + y) = (x^2 + y^2)(x + y) + x^2 + y^2\]
\[= (x^2 + y^2)(x + y + 1)\]

The ratio doesn't simplify to a function of $x^2 + y^2$ easily, but if we had $(x^2 + y^2)$ as a common factor throughout, it would work.
\end{example}

\section{Case 5: Power Form $\mu = x^a y^b$}

\begin{method}[Finding $\mu = x^a y^b$]
To find an integrating factor of the form $\mu = x^a y^b$:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Multiply the equation by $x^a y^b$
    \item Apply the exactness condition
    \item Compare powers of $x$ and $y$ on both sides
    \item Solve the resulting system for $a$ and $b$
\end{enumerate}
\end{method}

\begin{example}[Power Form]
Find $\mu = x^a y^b$ for $y dx + 2x dy = 0$

After multiplication: $x^a y^{b+1} dx + 2x^{a+1} y^b dy = 0$

Exactness requires:
\[\frac{\partial}{\partial y}(x^a y^{b+1}) = \frac{\partial}{\partial x}(2x^{a+1} y^b)\]
\[(b+1)x^a y^b = 2(a+1)x^a y^b\]
\[b + 1 = 2(a + 1)\]
\[b = 2a + 1\]

Choosing $a = -1$ gives $b = -1$, so $\mu = \frac{1}{xy}$ works.
\end{example}

\section{Case 6: Homogeneous Equations}

\begin{theorem}[Integrating Factor for Homogeneous Equations]
If $M(x,y)$ and $N(x,y)$ are homogeneous functions of the same degree $n$, then
\[\mu = \frac{1}{xM + yN}\]
is an integrating factor (provided $xM + yN \neq 0$).
\end{theorem}

\begin{proof}[Proof Outline]
Using Euler's theorem for homogeneous functions of degree $n$:
\[x\frac{\partial M}{\partial x} + y\frac{\partial M}{\partial y} = nM\]
\[x\frac{\partial N}{\partial x} + y\frac{\partial N}{\partial y} = nN\]

The exactness condition with $\mu = 1/(xM + yN)$ can be verified using these relations.
\end{proof}

\begin{keypoint}
\textbf{Quick Recognition of Homogeneous Equations:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item All terms have the same total degree in $x$ and $y$
    \item $M(tx, ty) = t^n M(x,y)$ for some $n$
    \item Common forms: rational functions where numerator and denominator have same degree
\end{itemize}
\end{keypoint}

\section{Strategy Flowchart}

\begin{algorithm}
\textbf{Complete Integrating Factor Strategy:}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Test for exactness - if exact, solve directly
    \item Test for $\mu(x)$: Is $(M_y - N_x)/N$ a function of $x$ only?
    \item Test for $\mu(y)$: Is $(N_x - M_y)/M$ a function of $y$ only?
    \item Check for homogeneity - if yes, use $\mu = 1/(xM + yN)$
    \item Test for $\mu(xy)$: Is $(M_y - N_x)/(xN - yM)$ a function of $xy$?
    \item Test for $\mu(x^2+y^2)$: Is $(M_y - N_x)/(xM + yN)$ a function of $x^2+y^2$?
    \item Try $\mu = x^a y^b$ by comparing powers
    \item Look for patterns or use inspection
\end{enumerate}
\end{algorithm}

\section{Memory Aids and Patterns}

\begin{examtip}
\textbf{Denominator Patterns:}
\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{|l|c|l|}
\hline
\textbf{Form} & \textbf{Test Denominator} & \textbf{Mnemonic} \\
\hline
$\mu(x)$ & $N$ & "N for x" \\
$\mu(y)$ & $M$ & "M for y" \\
$\mu(xy)$ & $xN - yM$ & "Cross product" \\
$\mu(x^2+y^2)$ & $xM + yN$ & "Dot product" \\
Homogeneous & $xM + yN$ & "Euler's friend" \\
\hline
\end{tabular}
\end{center}
\end{examtip}

\section{Common Exam Patterns}

\begin{warning}
Prof. Ditkowski often gives hints about the form:
\begin{itemize}
    \item "Find an integrating factor of the form $x^a y^b$"
    \item "Show that the equation has an integrating factor depending on $xy$"
    \item "Find $\mu$ assuming it depends only on $x^2 + y^2$"
\end{itemize}
When you see these hints, skip the testing phase and work directly with the given form!
\end{warning}

\section*{Solutions and Key Insights}

\textbf{Problem 1:}
(a) $\mu(x)$: $(M_y - N_x)/N = (2y + 2x - 2x + y)/(x^2 - xy) = 3y/(x^2 - xy)$ - has $y$, no $\mu(x)$
$\mu(y)$: $(N_x - M_y)/M = (2x - y - 2y - 2x)/(y^2 + 2xy) = -3y/(y^2 + 2xy) = -3/(y + 2x)$ - has $x$, no $\mu(y)$

(b) $\mu(xy)$: $(M_y - N_x)/(xN - yM) = 3y/(x(x^2 - xy) - y(y^2 + 2xy)) = 3y/(x^3 - x^2y - y^3 - 2xy^2)$

\textbf{Problem 8:}
$-y dx + x dy = 0$ has $M_y = -1$, $N_x = 1$, so $(M_y - N_x) = -2$
$xM + yN = x(-y) + y(x) = 0$ - Division by zero issue!
But note: $d(\arctan(y/x)) = \frac{x dy - y dx}{x^2 + y^2}$, so $\mu = 1/(x^2 + y^2)$ works!

\textbf{Problem 11:}
$y dx + 2x dy = 0$ with $\mu = x^a y^b$ gives:
$x^a y^{b+1} dx + 2x^{a+1} y^b dy = 0$
Exactness: $(b+1)x^a y^b = 2(a+1)x^a y^b$
So $b + 1 = 2(a + 1)$, giving $b = 2a + 1$
Family of solutions: $\mu = x^a y^{2a+1}$ for any $a$

\textbf{Problem 16:}
$(x^2 + y^2)dx + 2xy dy = 0$
Both $M$ and $N$ are homogeneous of degree 2.
$xM + yN = x(x^2 + y^2) + y(2xy) = x^3 + xy^2 + 2xy^2 = x^3 + 3xy^2$
So $\mu = 1/(x^3 + 3xy^2)$

\textbf{Key Strategy:} For Problem 23, notice the symmetry in $x$ and $y$ - this suggests $\mu = xy$ or $\mu = 1/(xy)$.

\textbf{Warning:} Problem 28 - If two different integrating factors exist, their ratio must be a function that makes the original equation exact when used as an integrating factor.

Test (My-Nx)/(xN-yM) for xy → μ(xy)
    ↓ No
Test (My-Nx)/(xM+yN) for x²+y² → μ(r²)
    ↓ No
Try μ = x^a y^b or inspection
```

**Step 7: Pattern Recognition Training**

**Immediate Recognition Patterns:**
1. **ydx - xdy appears** → μ = 1/xy or 1/x² or 1/y²
2. **xdx + ydy appears** → μ might involve x² + y²
3. **Same total degree** → Check homogeneous
4. **Cross symmetry** → Try μ(xy)
5. **Radial symmetry** → Try μ(x² + y²)

**Step 8: Common Mistakes to Avoid**

1. **Wrong denominator formula** - Each test has specific denominator
2. **Not simplifying before concluding** - Factor and cancel first
3. **Missing homogeneous cases** - Always check degrees
4. **Arithmetic errors in complex fractions** - Work carefully
5. **Giving up too soon** - Try all tests systematically
6. **Not verifying after finding μ** - Always check exactness

**Step 9: Speed Goals**
- Recognize form needed: 30 seconds
- Test for special μ: 2 minutes
- Find the integrating factor: 2 minutes
- Apply and solve: 4 minutes
- Total: 8-9 minutes per problem
