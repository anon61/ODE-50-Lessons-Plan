# **Lesson 41: Hartman-Grobman Theorem - When Linearization Works**

## **Part 1: Audio Lesson Script**

Welcome to Lesson 41! Today we're tackling one of the most important theorems in dynamical systems - the Hartman-Grobman theorem. This is the theorem that tells us WHEN we can trust linearization, and when we need to be careful. Prof. Ditkowski loves this because it connects mathematical rigor with practical application.

So basically, here's the big question from last lesson: we learned how to linearize nonlinear systems near critical points. But when does this linearization actually tell us the truth about the nonlinear system? That's exactly what Hartman-Grobman answers!

Let me give you the intuition first. Imagine you're looking at a photograph of a mountain landscape. If you zoom in on a rocky cliff face, the photo accurately shows you it's steep and jagged. But if you zoom in on the very peak - that transition point where one side goes up and the other goes down - the photo might not capture the full 3D nature of that saddle point. The Hartman-Grobman theorem tells us when our "linearization photo" is trustworthy.

Here's the key concept: a critical point is called HYPERBOLIC if all eigenvalues of the Jacobian have non-zero real parts. In other words, no eigenvalues lie on the imaginary axis. When a critical point is hyperbolic, Hartman-Grobman guarantees that the linearization tells us the complete local story!

The formal statement is beautiful: If $(x_0, y_0)$ is a hyperbolic equilibrium, then near this point, the nonlinear system and its linearization are "topologically conjugate." This fancy term means there's a continuous deformation that transforms trajectories of one system into trajectories of the other, preserving their essential behavior.

Let me show you what this means practically. Consider the system:
ẋ = x + y²
ẏ = -2y + x²

The only critical point is (0,0). The Jacobian at the origin is:
J = [1  0]
    [0 -2]

Eigenvalues are λ₁ = 1 and λ₂ = -2. Since both have non-zero real parts, this is hyperbolic! Hartman-Grobman tells us the origin is definitely a saddle point for the nonlinear system, just like its linearization predicts. The stable manifold comes in along the y-axis direction (corresponding to λ = -2), and the unstable manifold goes out along the x-axis direction (corresponding to λ = 1).

Now here's the crucial insight - what about those pesky nonlinear terms y² and x²? Hartman-Grobman says they might bend or curve the trajectories, but they CAN'T change the fundamental saddle structure. That's incredibly powerful!

But watch out - here's where students lose points with Prof. Ditkowski. The theorem does NOT apply when eigenvalues have zero real parts. Let me show you why this matters:

Consider: ẋ = y, ẏ = -x + x³

At the origin, J = [0  1], giving eigenvalues λ = ±i.
                [-1 0]

The linearization says "center" - closed orbits around the origin. But look what that x³ term does! Using energy methods (which we'll see in Lesson 42), you can show the origin is actually UNSTABLE for the nonlinear system. The cubic term completely changes the behavior! This is why Hartman-Grobman requires hyperbolicity.

Here's my memory trick: "HyGro" - Hyperbolic means Grobman works! If eigenvalues touch the imaginary axis, all bets are off.

Let's work through another example that Prof. Ditkowski loves - the bifurcation preview:
ẋ = μx + y - x³
ẏ = -x + μy

At (0,0), the Jacobian is [μ  1]. The eigenvalues are λ = μ ± i.
                          [-1 μ]

When is this hyperbolic? When Re(λ) ≠ 0, which means μ ≠ 0. So:
- If μ < 0: Stable spiral (Hartman-Grobman applies)
- If μ > 0: Unstable spiral (Hartman-Grobman applies)
- If μ = 0: Pure imaginary eigenvalues (Hartman-Grobman FAILS)

At μ = 0, we'd need more sophisticated techniques to determine behavior. This is called a Hopf bifurcation point!

Now, let me clarify what "topological conjugacy" really means for your exam. It preserves:
1. The direction of trajectories (stable stays stable, unstable stays unstable)
2. The existence of separatrices and manifolds
3. The qualitative behavior (nodes stay nodes, saddles stay saddles, spirals stay spirals)

But it does NOT preserve:
1. The exact shape of trajectories
2. The speed along trajectories
3. Distances or angles

Think of it like this: if linearization says "saddle," the nonlinear system might have curved separatrices instead of straight ones, but it's still fundamentally a saddle!

Here's another key insight for the exam. When Prof. Ditkowski asks "Is linearization valid?" you need to check:
1. Are all eigenvalues non-zero? (Non-degenerate)
2. Do all eigenvalues have non-zero real parts? (Hyperbolic)

If yes to both, write: "By the Hartman-Grobman theorem, linearization determines local behavior."
If no, write: "Hartman-Grobman does not apply; linearization may not determine behavior."

A classic exam question involves multiple equilibria. Consider:
ẋ = sin(x)
ẏ = y - cos(x)

Critical points are at x = nπ, y = cos(nπ) = (-1)ⁿ. For even n, we get (0,1), (2π,1), etc. For odd n, we get (π,-1), (3π,-1), etc.

At (0,1): J = [0   0], one zero eigenvalue - NOT hyperbolic!
             [0   1]

At (π,-1): J = [0    0], both eigenvalues positive - hyperbolic!
              [0    1]

So linearization works at (π,-1) but fails at (0,1). This is the kind of careful analysis Prof. Ditkowski expects!

The practical takeaway? When you linearize and get:
- Real eigenvalues with same sign: Definitively a node
- Real eigenvalues with opposite signs: Definitively a saddle
- Complex with non-zero real part: Definitively a spiral
- Purely imaginary or zero: Need additional analysis!

Remember, Hartman-Grobman is your guarantee that linearization isn't lying to you - but only when the hyperbolicity condition holds!

\section{Hyperbolicity - The Key Condition}

\begin{definition}[Hyperbolic Equilibrium]
A critical point $(x_0, y_0)$ of the nonlinear system
$$\dot{x} = f(x,y), \quad \dot{y} = g(x,y)$$
is called \textbf{hyperbolic} if all eigenvalues of the Jacobian matrix $J(x_0, y_0)$ have non-zero real parts. That is, if $\lambda_1, \lambda_2$ are the eigenvalues, then:
$$\text{Re}(\lambda_1) \neq 0 \quad \text{and} \quad \text{Re}(\lambda_2) \neq 0$$
\end{definition}

\begin{keypoint}
\textbf{Hyperbolic equilibria:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Nodes (all eigenvalues real with same sign)
    \item Saddles (real eigenvalues with opposite signs)
    \item Spirals (complex eigenvalues with non-zero real part)
\end{itemize}
\textbf{Non-hyperbolic equilibria:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Centers (purely imaginary eigenvalues)
    \item Degenerate nodes (zero eigenvalue)
    \item Any case with $\text{Re}(\lambda) = 0$ for some eigenvalue
\end{itemize}
\end{keypoint}

\section{The Hartman-Grobman Theorem}

\begin{theorem}[Hartman-Grobman]
Let $(x_0, y_0)$ be a hyperbolic equilibrium point of the $C^1$ system:
$$\dot{x} = f(x,y), \quad \dot{y} = g(x,y)$$
Then there exists a neighborhood $U$ of $(x_0, y_0)$ and a homeomorphism $h: U \to V$ (where $V$ is a neighborhood of the origin) such that $h$ maps trajectories of the nonlinear system to trajectories of the linearized system:
$$\dot{\xi} = J(x_0, y_0) \cdot \xi$$
preserving the direction of time.
\end{theorem}

\begin{insight}
The homeomorphism $h$ provides a \textbf{topological conjugacy} between the nonlinear and linear systems. This means:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item The qualitative behavior is identical
    \item Stable/unstable manifolds correspond
    \item The phase portrait structure is preserved
    \item But geometric properties (angles, distances) may change
\end{enumerate}
\end{insight}

\section{What Hartman-Grobman Tells Us}

\subsection{What IS Preserved}

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Stability type:} Stable remains stable, unstable remains unstable
    \item \textbf{Equilibrium type:} Nodes remain nodes, saddles remain saddles, spirals remain spirals
    \item \textbf{Invariant manifolds:} Stable and unstable manifolds exist with same dimensions
    \item \textbf{Local dynamics:} The direction of flow and separation of trajectories
\end{itemize}

\subsection{What is NOT Preserved}

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Trajectory shape:} Straight lines may become curves
    \item \textbf{Time parametrization:} Speed along trajectories may change
    \item \textbf{Metric properties:} Distances and angles are not preserved
    \item \textbf{Special structures:} Hamiltonian or gradient structure may be lost
\end{itemize}

\section{Applications and Examples}

\begin{example}[Hyperbolic Saddle]
Consider the system:
$$\dot{x} = x + y^2, \quad \dot{y} = -y + x^2$$

At the origin:
$$J(0,0) = \begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\ 0 & -1 \end{pmatrix}$$

Eigenvalues: $\lambda_1 = 1 > 0$, $\lambda_2 = -1 < 0$

Since both eigenvalues have non-zero real parts, the origin is hyperbolic. By Hartman-Grobman:
\begin{itemize}
    \item The origin is a saddle point for the nonlinear system
    \item There exists a 1D stable manifold (tangent to eigenvector for $\lambda = -1$)
    \item There exists a 1D unstable manifold (tangent to eigenvector for $\lambda = 1$)
    \item Near the origin, trajectories behave qualitatively like the linear saddle
\end{itemize}
\end{example}

\begin{example}[Non-hyperbolic Center]
Consider:
$$\dot{x} = -y + x(x^2 + y^2), \quad \dot{y} = x + y(x^2 + y^2)$$

At the origin:
$$J(0,0) = \begin{pmatrix} 0 & -1 \\ 1 & 0 \end{pmatrix}$$

Eigenvalues: $\lambda = \pm i$ (purely imaginary)

The origin is NOT hyperbolic. Hartman-Grobman does not apply! Indeed:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Linearization predicts a center (neutral stability)
    \item The actual nonlinear system has an unstable spiral!
    \item In polar coordinates: $\dot{r} = r^3 > 0$ for $r \neq 0$
\end{itemize}
\end{example}

\begin{warning}
\textbf{Common Exam Mistakes:}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Applying Hartman-Grobman when eigenvalues are purely imaginary
    \item Forgetting to verify hyperbolicity before concluding
    \item Claiming exact trajectory shapes are preserved
    \item Not recognizing when additional analysis is needed
\end{enumerate}
\end{warning}

\section{The Center Problem}

When linearization yields purely imaginary eigenvalues ($\lambda = \pm i\omega$), the nonlinear system near the equilibrium could be:

\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{|l|l|}
\hline
\textbf{Possibility} & \textbf{Determining Factor} \\
\hline
Center & Nonlinear terms preserve area/energy \\
Stable spiral & Nonlinear terms dissipate energy \\
Unstable spiral & Nonlinear terms add energy \\
More complex & Multiple timescale dynamics \\
\hline
\end{tabular}
\end{center}

\begin{examtip}
When Prof. Ditkowski gives you a system with purely imaginary eigenvalues:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item State clearly: "The equilibrium is non-hyperbolic"
    \item Write: "Hartman-Grobman theorem does not apply"
    \item Say: "Linearization alone cannot determine stability"
    \item If asked for more, use Lyapunov functions or compute higher-order terms
\end{enumerate}
\end{examtip}

\section{Structural Stability}

\begin{definition}[Structural Stability]
A system is \textbf{structurally stable} near an equilibrium if small perturbations to the system preserve the qualitative dynamics.
\end{definition}

\begin{theorem}[Consequence of Hartman-Grobman]
Hyperbolic equilibria are structurally stable. Small perturbations to $f$ and $g$ will:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Slightly move the equilibrium location
    \item Slightly change eigenvalues (keeping signs of real parts)
    \item Preserve the topological type
\end{itemize}
\end{theorem}

\begin{application}
In real-world modeling:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Hyperbolic equilibria} are robust to modeling errors
    \item \textbf{Non-hyperbolic equilibria} are sensitive to perturbations
    \item This explains why centers are rarely observed in practice
    \item Bifurcations occur when equilibria lose hyperbolicity
\end{itemize}
\end{application}

\section{Algorithm for Applying Hartman-Grobman}

\begin{mdframed}[linecolor=black, linewidth=1pt]
\textbf{Step-by-Step Procedure:}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Find the critical point $(x_0, y_0)$
    \item Compute the Jacobian $J(x_0, y_0)$
    \item Calculate eigenvalues $\lambda_1, \lambda_2$
    \item Check hyperbolicity:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item If $\text{Re}(\lambda_1) \neq 0$ AND $\text{Re}(\lambda_2) \neq 0$: HYPERBOLIC
        \item Otherwise: NON-HYPERBOLIC
    \end{itemize}
    \item If hyperbolic:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item State: "By Hartman-Grobman, linearization determines local behavior"
        \item Classify using linear theory
        \item Conclude about stability
    \end{itemize}
    \item If non-hyperbolic:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item State: "Hartman-Grobman does not apply"
        \item Note that additional analysis is required
        \item Consider Lyapunov functions or normal forms
    \end{itemize}
\end{enumerate}
\end{mdframed}

\section{Connection to Bifurcation Theory}

\begin{insight}
Bifurcations occur when a parameter change causes an equilibrium to lose hyperbolicity. Common scenarios:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Saddle-node:} Real eigenvalue crosses zero
    \item \textbf{Hopf:} Complex pair crosses imaginary axis
    \item \textbf{Pitchfork/Transcritical:} Zero eigenvalue appears
\end{itemize}
At bifurcation points, Hartman-Grobman fails and nonlinear terms determine the behavior!
\end{insight}

\section{Summary Table}

\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|c|}
\hline
\textbf{Eigenvalues} & \textbf{Hyperbolic?} & \textbf{H-G Applies?} & \textbf{Conclusion} \\
\hline
$\lambda_1, \lambda_2 < 0$ & Yes & Yes & Stable node \\
$\lambda_1, \lambda_2 > 0$ & Yes & Yes & Unstable node \\
$\lambda_1 < 0 < \lambda_2$ & Yes & Yes & Saddle \\
$\alpha \pm i\beta$, $\alpha \neq 0$ & Yes & Yes & Spiral (sign of $\alpha$) \\
$\pm i\beta$ & No & No & Inconclusive \\
$\lambda_1 = 0$, $\lambda_2 \neq 0$ & No & No & Inconclusive \\

- Request emphasis on the hyperbolicity condition
- Ask for clear examples of when the theorem fails
- Include discussion of the center problem
- Request connection to real-world stability

**Step 4: Study Progression**
1. **Foundation (1 hour):** Read theory document, focusing on Definition 1 and Theorem 1
2. **Audio Learning (45 min):** Listen while reviewing hyperbolic vs non-hyperbolic table
3. **Basic Practice (1 hour):** Complete Parts A and B
4. **Advanced Practice (1.5 hours):** Work through Parts C-E
5. **Synthesis (30 min):** Create a decision tree for applying Hartman-Grobman

**Step 5: Key Concepts Checklist**
After studying, verify you can:
- [ ] Define hyperbolic equilibrium precisely
- [ ] State the Hartman-Grobman theorem
- [ ] Identify when the theorem applies/fails
- [ ] Explain topological conjugacy intuitively
- [ ] Connect to structural stability
- [ ] Recognize the center problem

**Step 6: Common Exam Patterns**
Prof. Ditkowski typically tests Hartman-Grobman through:
1. "Determine which equilibria are hyperbolic"
2. "Can linearization determine the behavior? Justify."
3. "The linearization gives eigenvalues λ = ___. What can you conclude?"
4. Parameter-dependent problems where hyperbolicity changes

**Quick Reference Card to Create:**
```
HARTMAN-GROBMAN DECISION TREE
1. Find equilibrium (x₀,y₀)
2. Compute J(x₀,y₀)
3. Find eigenvalues λ₁,λ₂
4. Check: Re(λ₁) ≠ 0 AND Re(λ₂) ≠ 0?
   YES → Hyperbolic → H-G applies → Trust linearization
   NO → Non-hyperbolic → H-G fails → Need more analysis
```

**Integration with Other Lessons:**
- Lesson 40: Provides the linearization process
- Lesson 41: Tells when linearization is valid
- Lesson 42: Offers alternative (Lyapunov) when H-G fails

**Time-Saving Tips:**
1. For complex eigenvalues α ± iβ: Just check if α ≠ 0
2. For real eigenvalues: Check neither is zero
3. Pure imaginary (±iβ) or zero: Immediately non-hyperbolic

**Memory Aids:**
- "HyGro" - Hyperbolic means Grobman works
- "Real parts rule" - Non-zero real parts needed
- "Centers can't be trusted" - Purely imaginary = inconclusive

**Practice Priority:**
HIGH: Problems 6, 11, 16-17, 21-25
MEDIUM: Problems 1-5, 12-15
REVIEW: Problems 7-10, 18-20

**Warning Signs in Exam:**
- Words like "might," "could be," "possibly" → Check hyperbolicity!
- Parameter problems → Look for values where hyperbolicity fails
- "Justify using Hartman-Grobman" → Must verify conditions

**Prof. Ditkowski's Favorite Tricks:**
1. Systems with parameters where hyperbolicity fails at specific values
2. Multiple equilibria where some are hyperbolic and others aren't
3. Asking what happens "as parameter approaches critical value"
4. Hamiltonian/conservative systems (always non-hyperbolic centers)

**Total Study Time Required:**
- Theory absorption: 1.5 hours
- Practice problems: 2.5 hours
- Audio and review: 1 hour
- Total: 5 hours for mastery

**Self-Test Questions:**
1. Why does Hartman-Grobman require hyperbolicity?
2. What's the difference between topological and geometric equivalence?
3. Give an example where linearization predicts wrong stability
4. When do bifurcations occur in terms of hyperbolicity?
5. How does structural stability relate to Hartman-Grobman?
