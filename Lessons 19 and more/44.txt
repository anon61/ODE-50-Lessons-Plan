**Opening**

So basically, here's the problem that stumped mathematicians for years: What happens when your characteristic equation has repeated roots? In the last lesson, I told you that if r = 2 is a double root, you get solutions e^(2t) and te^(2t). But WHY? Why does that t appear? Today, we're going to uncover this mystery, and trust me, once you see it, you'll never forget it.

Let me start with a physical analogy. Imagine you're pushing a child on a swing. If you push at random times, not much happens. If you push at the natural frequency - that's resonance, big swings. But what if you push at EXACTLY the natural frequency with PERFECT timing? That's like a repeated root - the system doesn't just resonate, it resonates in a special, structured way that grows linearly with time.

**The Fundamental Problem**

Let's make this concrete. Consider y'' - 4y' + 4y = 0. The characteristic equation is r² - 4r + 4 = 0, which factors as (r - 2)² = 0. So r = 2 is a double root.

If we only use e^(2t), we get... just one solution. But this is a second-order equation - we need TWO linearly independent solutions. Where's the second one?

Here's the key insight: When roots collide (become repeated), the solution space needs to "expand" in a different direction. That direction is polynomial growth in time.

**Method 1: Reduction of Order (The Classical Approach)**

Let me show you the classical way to find the second solution. We know y₁ = e^(2t) works. Let's look for a second solution of the form y₂ = v(t)e^(2t), where v(t) is unknown.

Substituting into our ODE:
- y₂ = ve^(2t)
- y₂' = v'e^(2t) + 2ve^(2t)
- y₂'' = v''e^(2t) + 4v'e^(2t) + 4ve^(2t)

Plugging into y'' - 4y' + 4y = 0:
[v''e^(2t) + 4v'e^(2t) + 4ve^(2t)] - 4[v'e^(2t) + 2ve^(2t)] + 4[ve^(2t)] = 0

Expanding and simplifying:
e^(2t)[v'' + 4v' + 4v - 4v' - 8v + 4v] = 0
e^(2t)[v''] = 0

Since e^(2t) ≠ 0, we need v'' = 0. This means v' = c₁ and v = c₁t + c₂.

So our second solution is y₂ = (c₁t + c₂)e^(2t). Taking c₁ = 1 and c₂ = 0 gives us y₂ = te^(2t).

**Method 2: The Operator Perspective (The Modern View)**

Here's the more elegant way to see it. Think of our differential operator as L = D² - 4D + 4, where D = d/dt. The characteristic polynomial is (r - 2)², so we can write:

L = (D - 2)²

Now, what does (D - 2)²[y] = 0 mean? It means (D - 2)[(D - 2)[y]] = 0.

Let w = (D - 2)[y]. Then we need (D - 2)[w] = 0, which means w = Ce^(2t) for some function C.

Now we solve (D - 2)[y] = Ce^(2t). This is a first-order equation:
y' - 2y = Ce^(2t)

To solve this, we use an integrating factor μ = e^(-2t):
e^(-2t)y' - 2e^(-2t)y = C
d/dt[e^(-2t)y] = C
e^(-2t)y = Ct + K
y = (Ct + K)e^(2t)

So we naturally get both e^(2t) and te^(2t) as solutions!

**Method 3: The Limit Argument (The Intuitive View)**

Here's my favorite explanation - it's what really makes this click for students. Imagine we have two distinct roots that are very close: r₁ = 2 and r₂ = 2 + ε, where ε is tiny.

The general solution would be:
y = c₁e^(2t) + c₂e^((2+ε)t)

Let's rewrite this:
y = c₁e^(2t) + c₂e^(2t)e^(εt)

Now, what happens as ε → 0? We use the Taylor series: e^(εt) ≈ 1 + εt for small ε.

So: y ≈ c₁e^(2t) + c₂e^(2t)(1 + εt) = (c₁ + c₂)e^(2t) + c₂εte^(2t)

As ε → 0, we need to rescale our constants to keep both terms. Setting c₁ + c₂ = A and c₂ε = B (so c₂ = B/ε), we get:

y = Ae^(2t) + Bte^(2t)

The te^(2t) term emerges naturally as the limit of nearly repeated roots!

**Higher Multiplicities**

What if r = 2 has multiplicity 3? The pattern continues. We get:
- e^(2t) (the basic solution)
- te^(2t) (first correction)
- t²e^(2t) (second correction)

Each additional multiplicity adds another power of t. You can prove this by applying reduction of order repeatedly, or by considering (D - 2)³ = 0.

**Complex Repeated Roots**

Now here's where it gets really interesting. What if we have (r - (2 + 3i))² = 0? That's a repeated complex root.

The complex solutions are:
- e^((2+3i)t)
- te^((2+3i)t)

To get real solutions, we need to consider both this and its conjugate (r - (2 - 3i))² = 0. Converting to real form:

From e^((2±3i)t): e^(2t)cos(3t) and e^(2t)sin(3t)
From te^((2±3i)t): te^(2t)cos(3t) and te^(2t)sin(3t)

So for a complex pair with multiplicity 2, we get four real solutions involving both trigonometric functions and polynomial growth.

**The Jordan Form Connection**

For those who've studied linear algebra, here's the deep connection. When we convert y'' - 4y' + 4y = 0 to a first-order system:

Let x₁ = y and x₂ = y'. Then:
x₁' = x₂
x₂' = 4x₂ - 4x₁

In matrix form: X' = AX where A = [0, 1; -4, 4]

The eigenvalues of A are... 2 and 2! A repeated eigenvalue. The matrix A is not diagonalizable; instead, it has Jordan normal form:

J = [2, 1; 0, 2]

The off-diagonal 1 in the Jordan block is what creates the t term in the solution. When you compute e^(Jt), you get:

e^(Jt) = e^(2t)[1, t; 0, 1]

That t in the upper right is exactly our te^(2t) solution component!

**Example 1: Third-Order with Triple Root**

Solve: y''' - 6y'' + 12y' - 8y = 0

Characteristic equation: r³ - 6r² + 12r - 8 = 0

Let me factor this. Trying r = 2: 8 - 24 + 24 - 8 = 0. Yes!

So (r - 2) is a factor. Dividing: r³ - 6r² + 12r - 8 = (r - 2)(r² - 4r + 4) = (r - 2)(r - 2)² = (r - 2)³

Triple root at r = 2. Solutions:
- e^(2t)
- te^(2t)
- t²e^(2t)

General solution: y = (c₁ + c₂t + c₃t²)e^(2t)

**Example 2: Mixed Multiplicities**

Solve: y⁽⁴⁾ - 5y''' + 9y'' - 7y' + 2y = 0

After factoring (trust me on this): (r - 1)²(r - 2)² = 0

We have two double roots. Solutions:
- From r = 1 (multiplicity 2): e^t, te^t
- From r = 2 (multiplicity 2): e^(2t), te^(2t)

General solution: y = (c₁ + c₂t)e^t + (c₃ + c₄t)e^(2t)

**Wronskian Verification**

Let's verify that e^(2t) and te^(2t) are linearly independent using the Wronskian:

W = |e^(2t), te^(2t); 2e^(2t), (1+2t)e^(2t)| = e^(2t)·(1+2t)e^(2t) - te^(2t)·2e^(2t) = e^(4t)[(1+2t) - 2t] = e^(4t)

Since W = e^(4t) ≠ 0, the solutions are linearly independent.

**Common Mistakes and Exam Tips**

The biggest mistake students make? Forgetting to include ALL the t-powers. If you have a root of multiplicity 3, you need t⁰, t¹, AND t² terms (that's 1, t, and t²).

Another mistake: For complex repeated roots, students often forget that BOTH the sine and cosine need all the t-powers. If 2 + 3i has multiplicity 2, you need:
- e^(2t)cos(3t), te^(2t)cos(3t)
- e^(2t)sin(3t), te^(2t)sin(3t)

That's FOUR solutions from a complex pair of multiplicity 2.

Prof. Ditkowski loves to give you a characteristic polynomial already factored, like (r - 3)²(r² + 4) = 0, and ask for the general solution. Don't overthink it - just systematically list all solutions.

**Memory Technique**

Think of repeated roots as "running out of directions" in the exponential space, so the solution "escapes" into polynomial space. Each additional repetition pushes you one degree higher in the polynomial.

Or remember: "When roots repeat, add powers of t!"

**Closing**

So basically, repeated roots create polynomial growth because the solution space needs additional dimensions beyond simple exponentials. Whether you see it through reduction of order, operator factorization, limits of nearby roots, or Jordan forms, the result is the same: multiply by increasing powers of t. Next lesson, we'll use these homogeneous solutions to tackle non-homogeneous equations with the method of undetermined coefficients. The repeated roots will create resonance phenomena that are crucial for understanding physical systems.

\section{Introduction: The Problem of Repeated Roots}

When the characteristic equation of a linear ODE with constant coefficients has repeated roots, the naive approach of using only exponential solutions fails to generate enough linearly independent solutions.

\begin{definition}[Multiplicity of a Root]
If the characteristic polynomial $p(r)$ can be factored as $p(r) = (r - r_0)^m q(r)$ where $q(r_0) \neq 0$, then $r_0$ is a root of multiplicity $m$.
\end{definition}

\begin{theorem}[Dimension of Solution Space]
An $n$-th order linear homogeneous ODE has an $n$-dimensional solution space. Therefore, we need exactly $n$ linearly independent solutions.
\end{theorem}

\section{Failure of Simple Exponentials}

\begin{example}[The Problem]
Consider $y'' - 4y' + 4y = 0$ with characteristic equation $(r-2)^2 = 0$.

If we only use $y = e^{2t}$, we have just one solution. But we need two linearly independent solutions for this second-order equation.
\end{example}

\begin{keypoint}
When a root $r$ has multiplicity $m > 1$, the solution $e^{rt}$ alone cannot span the $m$-dimensional subspace of solutions corresponding to that root.
\end{keypoint}

\section{Derivation via Reduction of Order}

\begin{method}[Reduction of Order for Repeated Roots]
Given one solution $y_1 = e^{rt}$ where $r$ is a repeated root, we seek a second solution of the form:
$$y_2 = v(t) y_1 = v(t) e^{rt}$$
\end{method}

\begin{theorem}[Second Solution for Double Root]
If $r$ is a double root of the characteristic equation for $y'' + py' + qy = 0$, and $y_1 = e^{rt}$ is one solution, then $y_2 = te^{rt}$ is a second, linearly independent solution.
\end{theorem}

\begin{proof}
Let $y_2 = v(t)e^{rt}$. Then:
\begin{align}
y_2' &= v'e^{rt} + rve^{rt} \\
y_2'' &= v''e^{rt} + 2rv'e^{rt} + r^2ve^{rt}
\end{align}

Substituting into the differential equation:
$$v''e^{rt} + 2rv'e^{rt} + r^2ve^{rt} + p(v'e^{rt} + rve^{rt}) + qve^{rt} = 0$$

Factoring out $e^{rt}$:
$$v'' + v'(2r + p) + v(r^2 + pr + q) = 0$$

Since $r$ is a double root of $\lambda^2 + p\lambda + q = 0$:
\begin{enumerate}
\item $r^2 + pr + q = 0$ (r is a root)
\item $2r + p = 0$ (derivative of characteristic polynomial at r equals 0)
\end{enumerate}

Therefore: $v'' = 0$, giving $v = c_1t + c_2$.

Taking $c_1 = 1, c_2 = 0$ yields $y_2 = te^{rt}$.
\end{proof}

\section{The Differential Operator Approach}

\begin{insight}
The differential equation $(D - r)^m[y] = 0$ naturally produces solutions $t^k e^{rt}$ for $k = 0, 1, \ldots, m-1$.
\end{insight}

\begin{theorem}[Operator Factorization]
If the characteristic polynomial factors as $p(\lambda) = (\lambda - r)^m$, then the differential operator factors as:
$$L = (D - r)^m$$
where $D = \frac{d}{dt}$.
\end{theorem}

\begin{lemma}[Kernel of $(D - r)^m$]
The kernel (null space) of the operator $(D - r)^m$ is:
$$\text{ker}((D - r)^m) = \text{span}\{e^{rt}, te^{rt}, t^2e^{rt}, \ldots, t^{m-1}e^{rt}\}$$
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}[Proof by Induction]
Base case ($m = 1$): $(D - r)[y] = 0 \Rightarrow y = ce^{rt}$.

Inductive step: Assume true for $m = k$. For $m = k + 1$:
If $(D - r)^{k+1}[y] = 0$, let $w = (D - r)[y]$.
Then $(D - r)^k[w] = 0$, so $w = p_k(t)e^{rt}$ where $p_k$ is a polynomial of degree $\leq k-1$.

Solving $(D - r)[y] = p_k(t)e^{rt}$:
Using integrating factor $e^{-rt}$: $\frac{d}{dt}[e^{-rt}y] = p_k(t)$

Integrating: $e^{-rt}y = P_{k+1}(t) + C$ where $P_{k+1}$ has degree $\leq k$.

Therefore: $y = [P_{k+1}(t) + C]e^{rt} = p_{k+1}(t)e^{rt}$ where $\deg(p_{k+1}) \leq k$.
\end{proof}

\section{The Limit Perspective}

\begin{theorem}[Repeated Roots as Limits]
The solution $te^{rt}$ can be understood as the limit of solutions for nearby distinct roots.
\end{theorem}

\begin{proof}[Heuristic Derivation]
Consider two roots $r_1 = r$ and $r_2 = r + \epsilon$ with solutions:
$$y = c_1 e^{rt} + c_2 e^{(r+\epsilon)t}$$

Rewriting:
$$y = c_1 e^{rt} + c_2 e^{rt} e^{\epsilon t}$$

For small $\epsilon$: $e^{\epsilon t} \approx 1 + \epsilon t$

Thus:
$$y \approx (c_1 + c_2)e^{rt} + c_2 \epsilon t e^{rt}$$

As $\epsilon \to 0$, setting $A = c_1 + c_2$ and $B = \lim_{\epsilon \to 0} c_2 \epsilon$:
$$y = Ae^{rt} + Bte^{rt}$$
\end{proof}

\section{Higher Multiplicities}

\begin{theorem}[General Multiplicity Case]
If $r$ is a root of multiplicity $m$, then the $m$ linearly independent solutions are:
$$e^{rt}, \, te^{rt}, \, t^2e^{rt}, \, \ldots, \, t^{m-1}e^{rt}$$
\end{theorem}

\begin{formula}
For a root $r$ of multiplicity $m$:
$$\text{Solutions} = \{t^k e^{rt} : k = 0, 1, 2, \ldots, m-1\}$$
\end{formula}

\section{Complex Repeated Roots}

\begin{theorem}[Complex Repeated Roots]
If $\alpha \pm i\beta$ are complex conjugate roots each of multiplicity $m$, the $2m$ real-valued linearly independent solutions are:
$$t^k e^{\alpha t} \cos(\beta t), \, t^k e^{\alpha t} \sin(\beta t) \quad \text{for } k = 0, 1, \ldots, m-1$$
\end{theorem}

\begin{warning}
For complex repeated roots, both the sine AND cosine terms need all powers of $t$ up to $t^{m-1}$.
\end{warning}

\section{The Wronskian for Repeated Roots}

\begin{theorem}[Linear Independence via Wronskian]
The functions $\{t^k e^{rt} : k = 0, 1, \ldots, m-1\}$ are linearly independent.
\end{theorem}

\begin{proof}[Wronskian Calculation]
For simplicity, consider $m = 2$ with solutions $e^{rt}$ and $te^{rt}$:

$$W(t) = \begin{vmatrix}
e^{rt} & te^{rt} \\
re^{rt} & (1 + rt)e^{rt}
\end{vmatrix}$$

$$W(t) = e^{rt} \cdot (1 + rt)e^{rt} - te^{rt} \cdot re^{rt} = e^{2rt}(1 + rt - rt) = e^{2rt} \neq 0$$

For general $m$, the Wronskian is:
$$W(t) = e^{mrt} \cdot \prod_{0 \leq i < j < m} (j - i) \neq 0$$
\end{proof}

\section{Connection to Jordan Normal Form}

\begin{insight}
The appearance of $t^k$ terms in solutions corresponds exactly to the Jordan block structure of the companion matrix.
\end{insight}

\begin{theorem}[Jordan Form and Solutions]
For a system $\mathbf{x}' = A\mathbf{x}$ where $A$ has a Jordan block:
$$J = \begin{pmatrix}
\lambda & 1 & 0 & \cdots & 0 \\
0 & \lambda & 1 & \cdots & 0 \\
\vdots & \vdots & \ddots & \ddots & \vdots \\
0 & 0 & 0 & \lambda & 1 \\
0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & \lambda
\end{pmatrix}$$

The matrix exponential is:
$$e^{Jt} = e^{\lambda t} \begin{pmatrix}
1 & t & \frac{t^2}{2!} & \cdots & \frac{t^{m-1}}{(m-1)!} \\
0 & 1 & t & \cdots & \frac{t^{m-2}}{(m-2)!} \\
\vdots & \vdots & \ddots & \ddots & \vdots \\
0 & 0 & 0 & 1 & t \\
0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 1
\end{pmatrix}$$
\end{theorem}

\section{Algorithm for Repeated Roots}

\begin{method}[Complete Solution Construction]
\begin{enumerate}
\item Factor the characteristic polynomial completely.
\item For each distinct root $r_i$ with multiplicity $m_i$:
    \begin{itemize}
    \item If $r_i$ is real: Include solutions $t^k e^{r_i t}$ for $k = 0, 1, \ldots, m_i - 1$
    \item If $r_i = \alpha + i\beta$ is complex (with conjugate $\alpha - i\beta$):
        Include solutions $t^k e^{\alpha t} \cos(\beta t)$ and $t^k e^{\alpha t} \sin(\beta t)$ for $k = 0, 1, \ldots, m_i - 1$
    \end{itemize}
\item Form the general solution as a linear combination of all these functions.
\end{enumerate}
\end{method}

\section{Worked Examples}

\begin{example}[Triple Root]
Solve: $y''' - 3y'' + 3y' - y = 0$

\textbf{Solution:}
Characteristic equation: $r^3 - 3r^2 + 3r - 1 = 0$

Recognize this as $(r-1)^3 = 0$ (expand to verify).

Root: $r = 1$ with multiplicity 3.

Solutions: $e^t, te^t, t^2e^t$

General solution: $y(t) = (c_1 + c_2 t + c_3 t^2)e^t$
\end{example}

\begin{example}[Complex Double Roots]
Solve: $y^{(4)} + 8y'' + 16y = 0$

\textbf{Solution:}
Characteristic equation: $r^4 + 8r^2 + 16 = 0$

This is $(r^2 + 4)^2 = 0$, giving $(r - 2i)^2(r + 2i)^2 = 0$

Roots: $\pm 2i$, each with multiplicity 2.

Real solutions:
\begin{itemize}
\item From $2i$ (mult. 2): $\cos(2t), t\cos(2t), \sin(2t), t\sin(2t)$
\end{itemize}

General solution: $y(t) = (c_1 + c_2 t)\cos(2t) + (c_3 + c_4 t)\sin(2t)$
\end{example}

\begin{examtip}
Prof. Ditkowski often presents the characteristic polynomial already factored. Don't waste time trying to factor what's already factored - just identify multiplicities and write solutions systematically.

\item Real solutions: $e^t\cos(2t), te^t\cos(2t), e^t\sin(2t), te^t\sin(2t)$

\item $y(t) = (c_1 + c_2t)e^{-t} + (c_3 + c_4t + c_5t^2)e^{2t}$

\item $y(t) = (c_1 + c_2t)\cos(3t) + (c_3 + c_4t)\sin(3t)$
\end{enumerate}

\subsection*{Part C: Complete ODEs with Repeated Roots}

\begin{enumerate}[resume]
\item Char. eq.: $r^2 - 6r + 9 = (r-3)^2 = 0$\\
Root: $r = 3$ (mult. 2)\\
General solution: $y(t) = (c_1 + c_2t)e^{3t}$

\item Char. eq.: $r^3 + 3r^2 + 3r + 1 = (r+1)^3 = 0$\\
Root: $r = -1$ (mult. 3)\\
General solution: $y(t) = (c_1 + c_2t + c_3t^2)e^{-t}$

\item Char. eq.: $(r-1)^4 = 0$\\
Root: $r = 1$ (mult. 4)\\
General solution: $y(t) = (c_1 + c_2t + c_3t^2 + c_4t^3)e^t$

\item $(r+2)^2 = 0$, so $y = (c_1 + c_2t)e^{-2t}$\\
$y(0) = c_1 = 2$\\
$y'(t) = c_2e^{-2t} - 2(c_1 + c_2t)e^{-2t}$\\
$y'(0) = c_2 - 2c_1 = -3$\\
$c_2 = 1$\\
Solution: $y(t) = (2 + t)e^{-2t}$

\item $r^4 + 4r^2 + 4 = (r^2 + 2)^2 = 0$\\
Roots: $\pm i\sqrt{2}$ (each mult. 2)\\
$y(t) = (c_1 + c_2t)\cos(\sqrt{2}t) + (c_3 + c_4t)\sin(\sqrt{2}t)$
\end{enumerate}

\subsection*{Part D: Reduction of Order Applications}

\begin{enumerate}[resume]
\item Let $y_2 = v(t)e^{-t}$\\
Substituting into $(D+1)^2[y] = y'' + 2y' + y = 0$:\\
After simplification: $v'' = 0$\\
Thus $v = c_1t + c_2$\\
Second solution: $y_2 = te^{-t}$

\item $y = te^{3t}$\\
$y' = e^{3t} + 3te^{3t} = (1 + 3t)e^{3t}$\\
$y'' = 3e^{3t} + 3(1 + 3t)e^{3t} = (6 + 9t)e^{3t}$\\
Substitute: $(6 + 9t)e^{3t} - 6(1 + 3t)e^{3t} + 9te^{3t}$\\
$= e^{3t}[6 + 9t - 6 - 18t + 9t] = 0$ ✓

\item For double root $r$: $(D-r)^2[y] = 0$\\
If $y = te^{rt}$: $y' = e^{rt} + rte^{rt}$\\
$y'' = 2re^{rt} + r^2te^{rt}$\\
$(D-r)^2[y] = D[(D-r)[te^{rt}]] = D[e^{rt}] = re^{rt} - re^{rt} = 0$ ✓

\item $y_2 = v(t)e^{2t}$\\
$y_2' = (v' + 2v)e^{2t}$\\
$y_2'' = (v'' + 4v' + 4v)e^{2t}$\\
Substituting: $e^{2t}[v'' + 4v' + 4v - 4v' - 8v + 4v] = e^{2t} \cdot v'' = 0$\\
$v'' = 0 \Rightarrow v = c_1t + c_2$\\
Second solution: $y_2 = te^{2t}$

\item $W = \begin{vmatrix} e^{at} & te^{at} & t^2e^{at} \\ ae^{at} & (1+at)e^{at} & (2t+at^2)e^{at} \\ a^2e^{at} & (2a+a^2t)e^{at} & (2+4at+a^2t^2)e^{at} \end{vmatrix}$\\
After calculation: $W = 2e^{3at} \neq 0$
\end{enumerate}

\subsection*{Part E: Complex Repeated Roots}

\begin{enumerate}[resume]
\item $(r^2 + 4)^2 = 0 \Rightarrow r = \pm 2i$ (each mult. 2)\\
$y(t) = (c_1 + c_2t)\cos(2t) + (c_3 + c_4t)\sin(2t)$

\item $r^2 + 2r + 2 = 0 \Rightarrow r = -1 \pm i$\\
Each root has mult. 2\\
$y(t) = e^{-t}[(c_1 + c_2t)\cos(t) + (c_3 + c_4t)\sin(t)]$

\item Roots: $-1 \pm i$ (each mult. 2)\\
$y(t) = e^{-t}[(c_1 + c_2t)\cos(t) + (c_3 + c_4t)\sin(t)]$

\item 6 linearly independent real solutions:\\
$e^{2t}\cos(3t), te^{2t}\cos(3t), t^2e^{2t}\cos(3t)$\\
$e^{2t}\sin(3t), te^{2t}\sin(3t), t^2e^{2t}\sin(3t)$

\item Simple roots (not repeated): $r = -1 \pm 2i$\\
$y(t) = e^{-t}[c_1\cos(2t) + c_2\sin(2t)]$\\
$y(0) = c_1 = 0$\\
$y'(t) = e^{-t}[-c_1\cos(2t) - c_2\sin(2t) - 2c_1\sin(2t) + 2c_2\cos(2t)]$\\
$y'(0) = -c_1 + 2c_2 = 4$\\
$c_2 = 2$\\
Solution: $y(t) = 2e^{-t}\sin(2t)$
\end{enumerate}

\subsection*{Part F: Theoretical and Exam-Style Problems}

\begin{enumerate}[resume]
\item If $p(r) = (r - r_0)^m q(r)$ where $q(r_0) \neq 0$:\\
$p'(r) = m(r - r_0)^{m-1}q(r) + (r - r_0)^m q'(r)$\\
At $r = r_0$: $p'(r_0) = 0$ if $m > 1$\\
Continue differentiating to show $p^{(k)}(r_0) = 0$ for $k < m$\\
But $p^{(m)}(r_0) = m! \cdot q(r_0) \neq 0$

\item Total number of solutions = sum of all multiplicities = degree of polynomial = order of ODE

\item Char. poly: $(r-2)^2(r+1)(r-3) = 0$\\
$y = (c_1 + c_2t)e^{2t} + c_3e^{-t} + c_4e^{3t}$\\
Apply initial conditions (solve 4×4 system):\\
Final solution: $y(t) = (1 - \frac{2}{3}t)e^{2t} + \frac{1}{4}e^{-t} - \frac{1}{4}e^{3t}$

\item The operator $(D-r)^m$ has an $m$-dimensional kernel. The functions $t^k e^{rt}$ for $k = 0, \ldots, m-1$ are linearly independent (nonzero Wronskian) and all satisfy $(D-r)^m[y] = 0$.

\item
\begin{enumerate}[label=(\alph*)]
\item Char. eq.: $r^2 - 2ar + a^2 = (r-a)^2 = 0$\\
Always a double root at $r = a$

\item $y(t) = (c_1 + c_2t)e^{at}$

\item Bounded as $t \to \infty$ only if $a \leq 0$

\item $y(0) = c_1 = 1$\\
$y'(t) = c_2e^{at} + a(c_1 + c_2t)e^{at}$\\
$y'(0) = c_2 + ac_1 = 0$\\
$c_2 = -a$\\
Solution: $y(t) = (1 - at)e^{at}$
\end{enumerate}
\end{enumerate}

## **Component 4: NotebookLM Instructions**

# **NotebookLM Instructions for Lesson 44**

## **How to Use These Materials**

1. **Import Order**:
   - First: Audio Lesson Script (as text)
   - Second: Theory Document (compile LaTeX to PDF first)
   - Third: Practice Problems with solutions

2. **Audio Generation Settings**:
   - Choose "Technical/Educational" style
   - Enable mathematical notation verbalization
   - Set pace to "Moderate-Slow" for complex derivations
   - Request emphasis on the "WHY" behind repeated roots

3. **Study Sequence**:
   - **Day 1**: Listen to audio while reading theory document
   - **Day 2**: Work Parts A-C (focus on pattern recognition)
   - **Day 3**: Complete Parts D-F (deeper understanding)
   - **Day 4**: Review all solutions, focusing on mistakes

## **Key Concepts to Master**

### The Three Perspectives on Repeated Roots:
1. **Reduction of Order**: Classical approach, shows where $t$ comes from
2. **Operator Method**: Modern view, $(D-r)^m = 0$ naturally gives $t^k$
3. **Limit Argument**: Intuitive - repeated roots as "colliding" simple roots

### Critical Formulas:
- Root $r$ with multiplicity $m$: Solutions are $t^0e^{rt}, t^1e^{rt}, ..., t^{m-1}e^{rt}$
- Complex pair $\alpha \pm i\beta$ with mult. $m$: Get $2m$ real solutions using both sin and cos with all powers of $t$

## **Practice Problem Strategy**

### Part A (Identifying Multiplicities):
- Look for patterns: $(r-a)^m$, $(r^2 + b)^m$
- Remember: Complex roots come in conjugate pairs for real ODEs

### Part B (Solutions from Multiplicities):
- Systematic listing: For each root, write all $t^k$ terms
- Don't forget: Complex roots need BOTH sin and cos

### Part C (Complete ODEs):
- Factor characteristic polynomial completely
- Count solutions carefully - must equal order of ODE

### Part D (Reduction of Order):
- This is the "proof" section - understand the mechanism
- Verify solutions by substitution when asked

### Part E (Complex Repeated):
- Most error-prone section
- Each complex pair with mult. $m$ gives $2m$ real solutions

### Part F (Theory/Exam):
- Prof. Ditkowski's favorites
- Often combine concepts from multiple sections

## **Common Mistakes to Avoid**

1. **Undercounting solutions**: Multiplicity $m$ means $m$ solutions, not 1
2. **Complex roots**: Missing either sin or cos terms
3. **Powers of t**: Using $t, t^2, t^3$ instead of $t^0, t^1, t^2$ (missing the constant term)
4. **Initial conditions**: Forgetting to differentiate products when finding $y'(0)$

## **Memory Techniques**

### The "Multiplicity Ladder":
- Single root: One rung (just $e^{rt}$)
- Double root: Two rungs ($e^{rt}, te^{rt}$)
- Triple root: Three rungs ($e^{rt}, te^{rt}, t^2e^{rt}$)
- Each rung is one power of $t$

### The "Complex Dance":
- Complex roots always dance in pairs (conjugates)
- Each partner brings both sin and cos to the dance
- Repeated complex = multiple dance rounds (powers of $t$)

## **Connections to Other Topics**

### To Previous Lesson (43):
- Lesson 43 gave the "what" (solution forms)
- Lesson 44 explains the "why" (mathematical justification)

### To Next Lesson (45):
- Repeated roots cause resonance in non-homogeneous equations
- Understanding WHY helps predict when resonance occurs

### To Linear Algebra:
- Jordan blocks ↔ Repeated eigenvalues ↔ $t^k$ terms
- Non-diagonalizable matrices ↔ Repeated roots

## **Interactive NotebookLM Features**

1. **Generate flashcards for**:
   - Each root type and its solution form
   - The three methods for deriving repeated root solutions
   - Complex repeated root patterns

2. **Request explanations**:
   - "Explain reduction of order step-by-step for $y'' - 4y' + 4y = 0$"
   - "Why does the limit argument produce $te^{rt}$?"
   - "Show the connection between Jordan blocks and repeated roots"

3. **Create practice quizzes**:
   - Given a factored characteristic polynomial, write solutions
   - Identify when resonance will occur
   - Verify linear independence using Wronskian

## **Study Time Allocation**

- Understanding the three derivation methods: 2 hours
- Audio lesson + theory reading: 1.5 hours
- Practice Problems A-C: 1.5 hours
- Practice Problems D-F: 2 hours
- Review and synthesis: 1 hour
- **Total: 8 hours**

## **Exam Strategy for Repeated Roots**

1. **Quick identification**:
   - See $(r-a)^m$? Immediately write $t^0, t^1, ..., t^{m-1}$ times $e^{at}$
   - See $(r^2 + \omega^2)^m$? Get ready for $2m$ trig solutions

2. **Systematic writing**:
   - List each root with its multiplicity
   - Write all solutions for each root
   - Count total solutions (must equal ODE order)

3. **Initial value problems**:
   - Set up the general solution first
   - Differentiate carefully (product rule!)
   - Solve the linear system for constants

## **Advanced Understanding Questions**

Ask NotebookLM to explore:
1. What happens physically when resonance occurs (repeated roots)?
2. How do repeated roots affect system stability?
3. Why does the Wronskian still work for repeated roots?
4. What's the connection to generalized eigenvectors?
5. How do repeated roots appear in Laplace transform solutions?

## **Key Takeaway**

Repeated roots aren't a bug, they're a feature! The $t^k$ terms arise naturally from:
- The structure of the differential operator
- The limit of nearby roots
- The Jordan form of the companion matrix

Master all three perspectives to truly understand this topic.
