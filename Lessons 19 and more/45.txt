**Opening**

So basically, everything we've done so far has been for homogeneous equations - where the right-hand side is zero. But in the real world? Forces act on systems. Circuits have voltage sources. Springs get pushed. That's where non-homogeneous equations come in, and today I'm going to show you the most efficient method for solving them: undetermined coefficients.

Here's the beautiful thing about this method - it's purely algebraic. No integration needed. You just guess the right form, plug it in, and solve for coefficients. It's like having a cheat code for differential equations. But there's a catch - it only works for certain types of forcing functions. Let me show you exactly when and how to use it.

**The Non-Homogeneous Problem**

Consider the general non-homogeneous linear ODE with constant coefficients:
a_n y^(n) + ... + a_1 y' + a_0 y = f(t)

The complete solution has two parts:
y = y_h + y_p

where y_h is the homogeneous solution (from Lessons 43-44) and y_p is a particular solution that we need to find.

The homogeneous solution y_h contains all the arbitrary constants and satisfies the initial conditions. The particular solution y_p is just ONE solution that makes the equation work with the forcing function f(t).

**When Does This Method Work?**

Undetermined coefficients works when f(t) is a linear combination of:
1. Polynomials: t^n, t^2, t, constants
2. Exponentials: e^(at)
3. Sines and cosines: sin(bt), cos(bt)
4. Products of these: t^2 e^(3t), e^(-t)cos(2t), t·sin(t)

Why these functions? Because when you differentiate them, you get the same type of function back! A polynomial stays a polynomial (maybe lower degree), e^(at) stays e^(at), and trig functions stay trig functions. This closure property is what makes the method work.

**The Basic Strategy**

Here's the algorithm:
1. Identify the form of f(t)
2. Guess a particular solution y_p with the same form but undetermined coefficients
3. Substitute y_p into the ODE
4. Match coefficients to find the unknowns

Let me show you with examples.

**Example 1: Polynomial Forcing**

Solve: y'' - 3y' + 2y = 4t + 5

First, find y_h. Characteristic equation: r^2 - 3r + 2 = 0, giving r = 1, 2.
So y_h = c_1 e^t + c_2 e^(2t).

Now for y_p. Since f(t) = 4t + 5 is a first-degree polynomial, we guess:
y_p = At + B

Why not just At? Because when we differentiate, we'll get constants too, and we need to match all terms.

Calculate derivatives:
- y_p' = A
- y_p'' = 0

Substitute into the ODE:
0 - 3A + 2(At + B) = 4t + 5
2At + (2B - 3A) = 4t + 5

Matching coefficients:
- Coefficient of t: 2A = 4, so A = 2
- Constant term: 2B - 3A = 5, so 2B - 6 = 5, giving B = 11/2

Therefore: y_p = 2t + 11/2

Complete solution: y = c_1 e^t + c_2 e^(2t) + 2t + 11/2

**Example 2: Exponential Forcing**

Solve: y'' - 5y' + 6y = e^(4t)

Homogeneous: r^2 - 5r + 6 = 0, giving r = 2, 3.
So y_h = c_1 e^(2t) + c_2 e^(3t).

For f(t) = e^(4t), guess: y_p = Ae^(4t)

Derivatives:
- y_p' = 4Ae^(4t)
- y_p'' = 16Ae^(4t)

Substitute:
16Ae^(4t) - 5(4Ae^(4t)) + 6Ae^(4t) = e^(4t)
(16A - 20A + 6A)e^(4t) = e^(4t)
2Ae^(4t) = e^(4t)

So A = 1/2, giving y_p = (1/2)e^(4t).

**The Resonance Problem**

Now here's where it gets tricky. What if the forcing function matches one of your homogeneous solutions? This is called resonance, and it's where students make mistakes.

**Example 3: Resonance Case**

Solve: y'' - 5y' + 6y = e^(2t)

Same homogeneous solution: y_h = c_1 e^(2t) + c_2 e^(3t)

If we guess y_p = Ae^(2t), we have a problem! This is already in y_h. When we substitute, we'll get 0 = e^(2t), which is impossible.

The fix? Multiply by t:
y_p = Ate^(2t)

Now:
- y_p' = Ae^(2t) + 2Ate^(2t)
- y_p'' = 4Ae^(2t) + 4Ate^(2t)

Substitute:
[4Ae^(2t) + 4Ate^(2t)] - 5[Ae^(2t) + 2Ate^(2t)] + 6[Ate^(2t)] = e^(2t)
e^(2t)[4A + 4At - 5A - 10At + 6At] = e^(2t)
e^(2t)[-A] = e^(2t)

So A = -1, giving y_p = -te^(2t).

The rule: If your guess matches a homogeneous solution, multiply by t. If it still matches (repeated roots), multiply by t^2, and so on.

**Example 4: Trigonometric Forcing**

Solve: y'' + 4y = sin(3t)

Homogeneous: r^2 + 4 = 0, giving r = ±2i.
So y_h = c_1 cos(2t) + c_2 sin(2t).

For f(t) = sin(3t), we must guess BOTH sine and cosine:
y_p = A cos(3t) + B sin(3t)

Why both? Because derivatives of sine give cosine and vice versa. We need both to match.

Derivatives:
- y_p' = -3A sin(3t) + 3B cos(3t)
- y_p'' = -9A cos(3t) - 9B sin(3t)

Substitute:
[-9A cos(3t) - 9B sin(3t)] + 4[A cos(3t) + B sin(3t)] = sin(3t)
(-5A) cos(3t) + (-5B) sin(3t) = 0 + sin(3t)

Matching:
- Coefficient of cos(3t): -5A = 0, so A = 0
- Coefficient of sin(3t): -5B = 1, so B = -1/5

Therefore: y_p = -(1/5) sin(3t)

**Example 5: Resonant Trigonometric**

This is the most important case for physics - pure resonance.

Solve: y'' + 4y = sin(2t)

Now we have trouble! The forcing frequency matches the natural frequency. Our guess A cos(2t) + B sin(2t) is already in y_h.

Multiply by t:
y_p = t[A cos(2t) + B sin(2t)]

After substituting and simplifying (trust me, it's messy):
A = 1/4, B = 0

So y_p = (t/4) cos(2t)

This solution grows without bound - that's resonance! The amplitude increases linearly with time.

**The Superposition Principle**

When f(t) has multiple terms, handle each separately:

If f(t) = 3e^t + 2sin(t) - 4t^2, find particular solutions for each:
- y_p1 for 3e^t
- y_p2 for 2sin(t)
- y_p3 for -4t^2

Then y_p = y_p1 + y_p2 + y_p3.

**The Complete Guessing Table**

Here's your cheat sheet:

| f(t) | Guess y_p |
|------|-----------|
| Polynomial degree n | Polynomial degree n |
| e^(at) | Ae^(at) |
| sin(bt) or cos(bt) | A cos(bt) + B sin(bt) |
| t^n e^(at) | (Polynomial degree n) × e^(at) |
| e^(at) sin(bt) | e^(at)[A cos(bt) + B sin(bt)] |

If resonance occurs (guess matches homogeneous), multiply by t^s where s is the multiplicity of the matching root.

**Common Mistakes**

1. **Forgetting both sine and cosine**: Even if f(t) = cos(3t), you need both in y_p.

2. **Wrong degree polynomial**: If f(t) = t^3, you need y_p = At^3 + Bt^2 + Ct + D, not just At^3.

3. **Missing resonance**: Always check if your guess appears in y_h first!

4. **Product rules**: For f(t) = t^2 e^(3t), you need y_p = (At^2 + Bt + C)e^(3t), not just At^2 e^(3t).

**Memory Technique**

Think of it as "mimicry with modification":
- The particular solution mimics the forcing function
- But includes all related terms (lower degree polynomials, both trig functions)
- And modifies for resonance when needed

**Why Not Always Use This Method?**

Undetermined coefficients is fast but limited. It fails for:
- f(t) = tan(t), sec(t), ln(t), 1/t
- Any function that doesn't stay in a finite-dimensional space under differentiation

For these, we need variation of parameters (next topic in your course).

**Closing**

So basically, undetermined coefficients is pattern matching with algebra. Identify the forcing type, make an educated guess with unknown coefficients, substitute, and solve. The only subtlety is resonance - when your guess matches a homogeneous solution, multiply by t. Master this method and you'll solve 90% of the non-homogeneous ODEs on Prof. Ditkowski's exam in minutes instead of hours. It's pure algorithmic beauty.

\section{The Non-Homogeneous Linear ODE}

\begin{definition}[Non-Homogeneous Linear ODE]
An $n$-th order non-homogeneous linear ODE with constant coefficients has the form:
$$L[y] = a_n y^{(n)} + a_{n-1} y^{(n-1)} + \cdots + a_1 y' + a_0 y = f(t)$$
where $f(t) \not\equiv 0$ is called the forcing function or non-homogeneous term.
\end{definition}

\begin{theorem}[Structure of General Solution]
The general solution of $L[y] = f(t)$ is:
$$y(t) = y_h(t) + y_p(t)$$
where:
\begin{itemize}
    \item $y_h(t)$ is the general solution of the homogeneous equation $L[y] = 0$
    \item $y_p(t)$ is any particular solution of $L[y] = f(t)$
\end{itemize}
\end{theorem}

\begin{proof}
If $L[y_p] = f(t)$ and $L[y_h] = 0$, then:
$$L[y_h + y_p] = L[y_h] + L[y_p] = 0 + f(t) = f(t)$$
Conversely, if $y_1$ and $y_2$ both satisfy $L[y] = f(t)$, then:
$$L[y_1 - y_2] = L[y_1] - L[y_2] = f(t) - f(t) = 0$$
So $y_1 - y_2$ is a homogeneous solution.
\end{proof}

\section{Suitable Forcing Functions}

\begin{definition}[UC-Suitable Functions]
A function $f(t)$ is suitable for the method of undetermined coefficients if it belongs to a finite-dimensional space that is closed under differentiation.
\end{definition}

\begin{keypoint}
The method works for linear combinations of:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Polynomials: $t^n, t^{n-1}, \ldots, t, 1$
    \item Exponentials: $e^{at}$ where $a \in \mathbb{C}$
    \item Trigonometric: $\sin(bt), \cos(bt)$ where $b \in \mathbb{R}$
    \item Products: $t^n e^{at}, e^{at}\sin(bt), e^{at}\cos(bt), t^n e^{at}\sin(bt)$, etc.
\end{enumerate}
\end{keypoint}

\section{The Method: Non-Resonant Case}

\begin{method}[Undetermined Coefficients - Basic]
For $L[y] = f(t)$ where $f(t)$ is UC-suitable:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Solve the homogeneous equation $L[y] = 0$ to find $y_h$
    \item Based on the form of $f(t)$, guess the form of $y_p$ with undetermined coefficients
    \item Compute the derivatives of $y_p$
    \item Substitute into $L[y_p] = f(t)$
    \item Equate coefficients of like terms to determine the unknowns
    \item Write the general solution: $y = y_h + y_p$
\end{enumerate}
\end{method}

\subsection{Guessing Rules for Common Functions}

\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{|l|l|}
\hline
\textbf{Forcing Function $f(t)$} & \textbf{Trial Solution $y_p(t)$} \\
\hline
$P_n(t)$ (polynomial degree $n$) & $A_n t^n + A_{n-1}t^{n-1} + \cdots + A_1 t + A_0$ \\
\hline
$e^{at}$ & $Ae^{at}$ \\
\hline
$\sin(bt)$ or $\cos(bt)$ & $A\cos(bt) + B\sin(bt)$ \\
\hline
$P_n(t) e^{at}$ & $(A_n t^n + \cdots + A_0)e^{at}$ \\
\hline
$e^{at}\sin(bt)$ or $e^{at}\cos(bt)$ & $e^{at}[A\cos(bt) + B\sin(bt)]$ \\
\hline
$P_n(t) e^{at} \sin(bt)$ & $e^{at}[(A_n t^n + \cdots + A_0)\cos(bt) +$ \\
& $(B_n t^n + \cdots + B_0)\sin(bt)]$ \\
\hline
\end{tabular}
\end{center}

\begin{warning}
Always include both $\sin$ and $\cos$ terms when the forcing function contains either trigonometric function, as derivatives will produce both.
\end{warning}

\section{Resonance and the Modification Rule}

\begin{definition}[Resonance]
Resonance occurs when the trial solution $y_p$ (or part of it) is a solution of the homogeneous equation $L[y] = 0$.
\end{definition}

\begin{theorem}[Modification for Resonance]
If the standard trial solution is a homogeneous solution corresponding to a root $r$ of multiplicity $m$, multiply the trial solution by $t^m$.
\end{theorem}

\begin{insight}
Resonance physically corresponds to driving a system at its natural frequency, leading to unbounded growth in amplitude (the $t^m$ factor).
\end{insight}

\subsection{Resonance Detection Algorithm}

\begin{method}[Checking for Resonance]
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Find all roots of the characteristic equation (with multiplicities)
    \item For forcing function $f(t) = e^{at}g(t)$:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item If $a$ is not a characteristic root: no modification
        \item If $a$ is a simple root: multiply trial by $t$
        \item If $a$ is a root of multiplicity $m$: multiply trial by $t^m$
    \end{itemize}
    \item For $f(t) = e^{at}[\sin(bt) \text{ or } \cos(bt)]$:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Check if $a \pm ib$ are characteristic roots
        \item Multiply by $t^m$ where $m$ is the multiplicity
    \end{itemize}
\end{enumerate}
\end{method}

\section{The Superposition Principle}

\begin{theorem}[Superposition]
If $f(t) = f_1(t) + f_2(t) + \cdots + f_k(t)$ and $L[y_{p_i}] = f_i(t)$ for each $i$, then:
$$L[y_{p_1} + y_{p_2} + \cdots + y_{p_k}] = f_1(t) + f_2(t) + \cdots + f_k(t)$$
Therefore: $y_p = y_{p_1} + y_{p_2} + \cdots + y_{p_k}$
\end{theorem}

\begin{keypoint}
Handle each term in $f(t)$ separately, then add the particular solutions. This often simplifies the algebra significantly.
\end{keypoint}

\section{Comprehensive Examples}

\begin{example}[Polynomial Forcing]
Solve: $y'' - 3y' + 2y = 6t^2 - 4t + 1$

\textbf{Solution:}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Homogeneous: $r^2 - 3r + 2 = 0 \Rightarrow r = 1, 2$

    Thus: $y_h = c_1 e^t + c_2 e^{2t}$

    \item Trial: $y_p = At^2 + Bt + C$

    \item Derivatives: $y_p' = 2At + B$, $y_p'' = 2A$

    \item Substitute:
    $$2A - 3(2At + B) + 2(At^2 + Bt + C) = 6t^2 - 4t + 1$$
    $$2At^2 + (-6A + 2B)t + (2A - 3B + 2C) = 6t^2 - 4t + 1$$

    \item Match coefficients:
    \begin{align}
    t^2: & \quad 2A = 6 \Rightarrow A = 3 \\
    t^1: & \quad -6A + 2B = -4 \Rightarrow B = 7 \\
    t^0: & \quad 2A - 3B + 2C = 1 \Rightarrow C = 8
    \end{align}

    \item Solution: $y = c_1 e^t + c_2 e^{2t} + 3t^2 + 7t + 8$
\end{enumerate}
\end{example}

\begin{example}[Resonant Exponential]
Solve: $y'' - 4y' + 4y = e^{2t}$

\textbf{Solution:}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Homogeneous: $(r-2)^2 = 0 \Rightarrow r = 2$ (double root)

    Thus: $y_h = (c_1 + c_2 t)e^{2t}$

    \item Standard trial $Ae^{2t}$ appears in $y_h$ (resonance!)

    Since 2 is a double root, multiply by $t^2$: $y_p = At^2 e^{2t}$

    \item Derivatives:
    \begin{align}
    y_p' &= 2Ate^{2t} + 2At^2e^{2t} = 2Ate^{2t}(1 + t) \\
    y_p'' &= 2Ae^{2t}(1 + 4t + 2t^2)
    \end{align}

    \item Substitute and simplify: $2Ae^{2t} = e^{2t}$

    \item Thus $A = 1/2$ and $y_p = \frac{t^2}{2}e^{2t}$
\end{enumerate}
\end{example}

\begin{example}[Resonant Trigonometric]
Solve: $y'' + \omega^2 y = F_0 \cos(\omega t)$

\textbf{Solution:}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Homogeneous: $r^2 + \omega^2 = 0 \Rightarrow r = \pm i\omega$

    Thus: $y_h = c_1 \cos(\omega t) + c_2 \sin(\omega t)$

    \item Resonance! Multiply by $t$: $y_p = t[A\cos(\omega t) + B\sin(\omega t)]$

    \item After substitution: $A = 0$, $B = \frac{F_0}{2\omega}$

    \item Solution exhibits linear growth: $y_p = \frac{F_0 t}{2\omega}\sin(\omega t)$
\end{enumerate}
\end{example}

\section{Common Pitfalls and Tips}

\begin{warning}
Common mistakes to avoid:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Forgetting lower-degree terms in polynomial trials
    \item Omitting sine or cosine in trigonometric trials
    \item Missing resonance when the forcing matches homogeneous solutions
    \item Wrong multiplicity in resonance modification
    \item Arithmetic errors in coefficient matching
\end{enumerate}
\end{warning}

\begin{examtip}
Prof. Ditkowski's exam strategy:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Always find $y_h$ first and write it clearly
    \item Check for resonance before writing trial solution
    \item For mixed forcing terms, use superposition
    \item Verify one coefficient as a check
    \item State the general solution explicitly
\end{enumerate}
\end{examtip}

\subsection*{Part E: Initial Value Problems}

\begin{enumerate}[resume]
\item General: $y = c_1e^t + c_2e^{2t} + e^{3t}$\\
$y(0) = c_1 + c_2 + 1 = 1 \Rightarrow c_1 + c_2 = 0$\\
$y'(0) = c_1 + 2c_2 + 3 = 2 \Rightarrow c_1 + 2c_2 = -1$\\
Solving: $c_2 = -1$, $c_1 = 1$\\
Solution: $y = e^t - e^{2t} + e^{3t}$

\item General: $y = c_1\cos(2t) + c_2\sin(2t) + 2t$\\
$y(0) = c_1 = 0$\\
$y'(0) = 2c_2 + 2 = 1 \Rightarrow c_2 = -1/2$\\

\end{enumerate}

\subsection*{Part F: Exam-Style Problems}

\begin{enumerate}[resume]
\item
\begin{enumerate}[label=(\alph*)]
\item $(r+1)^2 = 0$, so $r = -1$ is a double root. Standard trial $Ae^{-t}$ is already in $y_h$.
\item Use $y_p = At^2e^{-t}$. After substitution: $A = 1/2$.
\item This represents critical damping with resonant forcing.
\end{enumerate}

\item
\begin{enumerate}[label=(\alph*)]
\item Non-resonant: $y = c_1\cos(\omega_0 t) + c_2\sin(\omega_0 t) + \frac{F_0}{\omega_0^2 - \omega^2}\cos(\omega t)$
\item Resonant: $y = c_1\cos(\omega_0 t) + c_2\sin(\omega_0 t) + \frac{F_0 t}{2\omega_0}\sin(\omega_0 t)$
\item As $\omega \to \omega_0$, amplitude $\to \infty$ (beats phenomenon)
\end{enumerate}

\item $(r-2)^2 = 0$ gives double root at $r = 2$.\\
$y_p = Ae^{at}$ works only if $a \neq 2$.\\
All values except $a = 2$.

\item Characteristic: $r^2 + pr + q = 0$\\
Resonance occurs when $r$ satisfies this, i.e., $r^2 + pr + q = 0$.

\item $(r^2 + 1)^2 = 0$ gives $r = \pm i$ with multiplicity 2.\\
For $\cos(t)$: double resonance!\\
$y_p = t^2[A\cos(t) + B\sin(t)]$\\
After substitution: $A = 0$, $B = 1/8$\\
$y = (c_1 + c_2t)\cos(t) + (c_3 + c_4t)\sin(t) + \frac{t^2}{8}\sin(t)$
\end{enumerate}

## **Component 4: NotebookLM Instructions**

# **NotebookLM Instructions for Lesson 45**

## **How to Use These Materials**

1. **Import Order**:
   - First: Audio Lesson Script (essential for conceptual understanding)
   - Second: Theory Document (formalize the concepts)
   - Third: Practice Problems (apply and master)

2. **Audio Generation Settings**:
   - Style: "Problem-Solving Tutorial"
   - Include worked examples verbally
   - Emphasize the decision tree for choosing trial solutions
   - Pause points before each new concept

3. **Study Sequence**:
   - **Day 1**: Audio + Theory (understand the method)
   - **Day 2**: Parts A-B (basic and resonance)
   - **Day 3**: Parts C-D (products and superposition)
   - **Day 4**: Parts E-F (IVPs and exam problems)

## **Core Algorithm to Master**

### The UC Method Decision Tree:
```
1. Find homogeneous solution y_h
2. Identify f(t) type
3. Write standard trial solution
4. Check: Does trial appear in y_h?
   - No → Use standard trial
   - Yes → Multiply by t^m (m = multiplicity)
5. Substitute and solve for coefficients
6. Combine: y = y_h + y_p
```

## **Trial Solution Quick Reference**

Create flashcards for each:

| f(t) Type | Standard Trial | If Resonant (mult. m) |
|-----------|---------------|------------------------|
| Constant k | A | At^m |
| Polynomial P_n(t) | A_n t^n + ... + A_0 | t^m(A_n t^n + ... + A_0) |
| e^(at) | Ae^(at) | At^m e^(at) |
| sin(bt) or cos(bt) | A cos(bt) + B sin(bt) | t^m[A cos(bt) + B sin(bt)] |
| P_n(t)e^(at) | (A_n t^n + ... + A_0)e^(at) | t^m(A_n t^n + ... + A_0)e^(at) |

## **Common Mistakes Checklist**

Before solving any problem:
- [ ] Found ALL roots of characteristic equation?
- [ ] Identified ALL terms in f(t)?
- [ ] Included BOTH sin and cos for trig forcing?
- [ ] Included ALL polynomial degrees (not just highest)?
- [ ] Checked for resonance?
- [ ] Applied correct multiplicity for resonance?

## **Practice Problem Strategy by Part**

### Part A (Basic Non-Resonant):
- Straightforward application
- Focus on coefficient matching technique
- Verify at least one coefficient as a check

### Part B (Resonance):
- ALWAYS check if trial is in y_h first
- Count multiplicity carefully
- Remember: t^m where m is the multiplicity

### Part C (Products):
- Products need complete polynomial sets
- e^(at)sin(bt) needs BOTH trig functions
- Check resonance for the exponential part

### Part D (Superposition):
- Handle each term separately
- Add all particular solutions
- Watch for different types of resonance

### Part E (IVPs):
- Find general solution first
- Apply conditions to full solution
- Check: Does solution satisfy both ODE and ICs?

### Part F (Theory/Exam):
- These test deep understanding
- Physical interpretation matters
- Prof. Ditkowski loves resonance questions

## **Memory Techniques**

### "The Three Questions":
1. What's the form? (polynomial, exp, trig, product)
2. Is it resonant? (check against y_h)
3. What's the multiplicity? (for resonance modification)

### "PEST" for forcing types:
- **P**olynomial
- **E**xponential
- **S**ine/Cosine
- **T**heir products

### Resonance Rhyme:
"If your guess is in y_h,
Multiply by t to the m-th"

## **Physical Interpretation**

Ask NotebookLM to explain:
- Non-resonant: Steady-state response at forcing frequency
- Resonant: Linear growth (dangerous in real systems!)
- Damped resonance: Eventually bounded but large transient

## **Connections to Other Lessons**

### From Previous:
- Lesson 43: Provides y_h (characteristic equation)
- Lesson 44: Explains why t^m appears in resonance

### To Next:
- Lesson 46: Reduction of order (theoretical foundation)
- Lesson 47: Euler equations (different coefficient type)
- Future: Variation of parameters (when UC fails)

## **Speed Techniques for Exams**

1. **Quick Resonance Check**:
   - Write characteristic roots first
   - Circle any that match forcing exponentials
   - Box any that match forcing frequencies

2. **Coefficient Matching**:
   - Set up equations systematically
   - Use matrix form for multiple unknowns
   - Check easiest coefficient first

3. **Superposition Shortcut**:
   - Number each f(t) term
   - Write y_p = y_p1 + y_p2 + ...
   - Solve each independently

## **Interactive NotebookLM Features**

1. **Generate practice with variations**:
   - "Give me 5 problems like Part B #7 but with different roots"
   - "Create resonance problems with triple roots"
   - "Mix polynomial and exponential forcing"

2. **Concept checks**:
   - "Why do we need both sin and cos?"
   - "Explain resonance physically"
   - "When does UC method fail?"

3. **Solution verification**:
   - "Check if y = ... satisfies the ODE"
   - "Verify my coefficient matching"
   - "Is this the correct trial solution?"

## **Study Time Allocation**

- Understanding the method: 1.5 hours
- Audio lesson + theory: 1.5 hours
- Practice A-B (basic + resonance): 2 hours
- Practice C-D (products + superposition): 2 hours
- Practice E-F (IVPs + exam): 2 hours
- Review and synthesis: 1 hour
- **Total: 10 hours**

## **Exam Strategy Specific to UC**

1. **Time-saving order**:
   - Write y_h immediately
   - Identify f(t) type
   - Check resonance
   - Write trial (with modifications if needed)
   - Set up coefficient equations
   - Solve systematically

2. **Partial credit strategy**:
   - Always write the correct trial form (even if you can't solve)
   - Show resonance check explicitly
   - Set up coefficient matching equations
   - State general solution form

3. **Common exam tricks**:
   - f(t) = sin(ωt) where ω matches natural frequency
   - Hidden resonance in product terms
   - Multiple resonances in superposition

## **Advanced Questions for Understanding**

Ask NotebookLM:
1. Why does UC fail for f(t) = tan(t)?
2. How does resonance relate to eigenvalues?
3. What's the connection to Fourier series?
4. Why is superposition valid only for linear ODEs?
5. How does this extend to systems of ODEs?

## **Key Formula Sheet Items**

Must memorize:
- Standard trial forms (the table)
- Resonance modification: multiply by t^m
- Superposition principle
- Common derivatives of products

## **Final Mastery Check**

You've mastered UC when you can:
- [ ] Identify trial solution in < 10 seconds
- [ ] Spot resonance immediately
- [ ] Set up coefficient equations without errors
- [ ] Handle 3+ term superposition confidently
- [ ] Explain physical meaning of resonance

## **Most Important Takeaway**

Undetermined Coefficients is algorithmic:
1. It ALWAYS works for PEST functions
2. Resonance is handled by multiplying by t^m
3. Superposition makes complex problems simple
4. It's faster than variation of parameters when applicable

Master this method - it's 40% of Prof. Ditkowski's non-homogeneous ODE problems!
