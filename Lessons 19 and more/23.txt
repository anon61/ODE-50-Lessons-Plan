# **Lesson 23: Integrating Factors - μ(x) and μ(y) Cases**

## **Part 1: Audio Lesson Script**

*[Opening with enthusiasm]*

So you've tested an equation for exactness and... it failed! The partial derivatives don't match. Game over? Not at all! Here's the key insight that'll blow your mind: we can often multiply the entire equation by a special function called an integrating factor, and boom - it becomes exact! It's like having a magic wand that transforms unsolvable equations into ones we already know how to handle.

Let me show you the big picture first. When we have a non-exact equation Mdx + Ndy = 0, we're looking for a function μ (that's the Greek letter mu) such that when we multiply everything by μ, the new equation μMdx + μNdy = 0 IS exact. The beauty is that the solutions don't change - we're just repackaging the same equation in a friendlier form.

Now here's where it gets interesting. In theory, integrating factors always exist, but finding them can be incredibly hard. The good news? For Prof. Ditkowski's exam, we focus on two special cases that cover 90% of problems: when μ depends only on x, written as μ(x), or only on y, written as μ(y).

So basically, how do we know if μ(x) exists? Here's the magical formula - and yes, you need to memorize this! Calculate (∂M/∂y - ∂N/∂x)/N. If this expression depends ONLY on x - no y's anywhere - then μ(x) exists, and we find it by solving dμ/dx = μ · [(My - Nx)/N].

Let me walk you through an example. Consider (3xy + y²)dx + (x² + xy)dy = 0. First, check exactness: ∂M/∂y = 3x + 2y and ∂N/∂x = 2x + y. Not equal - not exact! Now let's check for μ(x): (My - Nx)/N = (3x + 2y - 2x - y)/(x² + xy) = (x + y)/(x² + xy) = (x + y)/(x(x + y)) = 1/x.

Beautiful! This depends only on x. So we have dμ/dx = μ/x, which gives μ = x (choosing the constant of integration as 1 for simplicity). Multiply the original equation by x: (3x²y + xy²)dx + (x³ + x²y)dy = 0. Now check: ∂M/∂y = 3x² + 2xy and ∂N/∂x = 3x² + 2xy. They match! It's exact!

What about μ(y)? The test is similar but flipped: calculate (∂N/∂x - ∂M/∂y)/M. If this depends only on y, then μ(y) exists. Notice the numerator is the negative of what we had before, and now we divide by M instead of N.

Here's a classic example Prof. Ditkowski loves: (2y)dx + (3x)dy = 0. Check exactness: ∂M/∂y = 2, ∂N/∂x = 3. Not exact! For μ(x): (2-3)/3x = -1/3x, depends on x. For μ(y): (3-2)/2y = 1/2y, depends on y. Both exist!

Let's use μ(y) = y^(1/2). Multiplying: (2y^(3/2))dx + (3xy^(1/2))dy = 0. Check: ∂M/∂y = 3y^(1/2), ∂N/∂x = 3y^(1/2). Exact! The potential function is H = 2xy^(3/2), so solutions are xy^(3/2) = C.

Common mistake alert! Students often forget that after finding μ and multiplying, you still need to solve the resulting exact equation. Finding the integrating factor is only half the battle - you then use the methods from Lesson 22 to find the potential function!

Here's a memory trick I love: "My Nexus over N" gives μ(x), while "Nexus My over M" gives μ(y). The one with x in the denominator gives μ(x), the one with y sound (My) in the denominator gives μ(y).

Now, what if neither test works? What if (My - Nx)/N has both x and y, and so does (Nx - My)/M? Then neither μ(x) nor μ(y) exists, and we need fancier integrating factors - that's next lesson's adventure with μ(xy) and other special forms.

Prof. Ditkowski's exam tip: He often gives hints like "Find an integrating factor depending only on x" or "Show that μ = x² is an integrating factor." When you see these hints, you skip the existence test and jump straight to verification or using the given factor.

Remember linear equations from Block 5? The integrating factor μ = e^(∫P(x)dx) for y' + P(x)y = Q(x)? That's a special case of this general theory! Linear equations always have μ(x) because they can be written as (Py - Q)dx + dy = 0, and our test gives (P - 0)/1 = P(x), which depends only on x.

The physical interpretation is cool too. Sometimes the original equation represents a non-conservative force field, but there's a hidden weighting function (the integrating factor) that reveals an underlying conservation law. It's like finding the right perspective that shows the hidden structure!

So basically, integrating factors are your rescue plan when exactness fails. Check for μ(x) first (usually simpler), then μ(y) if needed. Once you find μ, multiply through, verify exactness, and solve using the methods from Lesson 22. Master this, and you'll handle 90% of non-exact equations on the exam!

\section{The Concept of Integrating Factors}

\begin{definition}[Integrating Factor]
An \textbf{integrating factor} $\mu(x,y)$ for the equation
\[M(x,y)dx + N(x,y)dy = 0\]
is a function such that the equation
\[\mu(x,y)M(x,y)dx + \mu(x,y)N(x,y)dy = 0\]
is exact.
\end{definition}

\begin{keypoint}
Multiplying by an integrating factor doesn't change the solutions - it only changes the form of the equation. If $y = f(x)$ is a solution to the original equation, it remains a solution to the modified equation.
\end{keypoint}

\section{Condition for Exactness After Multiplication}

For $\mu M dx + \mu N dy = 0$ to be exact, we need:
\[\frac{\partial(\mu M)}{\partial y} = \frac{\partial(\mu N)}{\partial x}\]

Expanding using the product rule:
\[\mu \frac{\partial M}{\partial y} + M\frac{\partial \mu}{\partial y} = \mu \frac{\partial N}{\partial x} + N\frac{\partial \mu}{\partial x}\]

Rearranging:
\[M\frac{\partial \mu}{\partial y} - N\frac{\partial \mu}{\partial x} = \mu\left(\frac{\partial N}{\partial x} - \frac{\partial M}{\partial y}\right)\]

\begin{warning}
This is a partial differential equation for $\mu$ - generally very difficult to solve! We look for special cases where $\mu$ depends on only one variable.
\end{warning}

\section{Case 1: Integrating Factor $\mu(x)$}

\begin{theorem}[Existence of $\mu(x)$]
An integrating factor depending only on $x$ exists if and only if
\[\frac{1}{N}\left(\frac{\partial M}{\partial y} - \frac{\partial N}{\partial x}\right) = g(x)\]
where $g(x)$ is a function of $x$ alone. The integrating factor is then:
\[\mu(x) = e^{\int g(x)\,dx}\]
\end{theorem}

\begin{proof}
If $\mu = \mu(x)$, then $\frac{\partial \mu}{\partial y} = 0$. The exactness condition becomes:
\[-N\frac{d\mu}{dx} = \mu\left(\frac{\partial N}{\partial x} - \frac{\partial M}{\partial y}\right)\]
\[\frac{1}{\mu}\frac{d\mu}{dx} = \frac{1}{N}\left(\frac{\partial M}{\partial y} - \frac{\partial N}{\partial x}\right)\]
This is solvable only if the right side depends solely on $x$.
\end{proof}

\begin{algorithm}
\textbf{Finding $\mu(x)$:}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Compute $\frac{\partial M}{\partial y}$ and $\frac{\partial N}{\partial x}$
    \item Calculate $R(x,y) = \frac{M_y - N_x}{N}$
    \item If $R = g(x)$ (function of $x$ only), then:
    \[\mu(x) = e^{\int g(x)\,dx}\]
    \item If $R$ contains $y$, then $\mu(x)$ doesn't exist
\end{enumerate}
\end{algorithm}

\section{Case 2: Integrating Factor $\mu(y)$}

\begin{theorem}[Existence of $\mu(y)$]
An integrating factor depending only on $y$ exists if and only if
\[\frac{1}{M}\left(\frac{\partial N}{\partial x} - \frac{\partial M}{\partial y}\right) = h(y)\]
where $h(y)$ is a function of $y$ alone. The integrating factor is:
\[\mu(y) = e^{\int h(y)\,dy}\]
\end{theorem}

\begin{algorithm}
\textbf{Finding $\mu(y)$:}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Compute $\frac{\partial M}{\partial y}$ and $\frac{\partial N}{\partial x}$
    \item Calculate $S(x,y) = \frac{N_x - M_y}{M}$
    \item If $S = h(y)$ (function of $y$ only), then:
    \[\mu(y) = e^{\int h(y)\,dy}\]
    \item If $S$ contains $x$, then $\mu(y)$ doesn't exist
\end{enumerate}
\end{algorithm}

\section{Complete Solution Process}

\begin{keypoint}
\textbf{Step-by-Step Solution with Integrating Factors:}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Test for exactness (if exact, skip to step 6)
    \item Check if $\mu(x)$ exists: Is $(M_y - N_x)/N$ a function of $x$ only?
    \item If not, check if $\mu(y)$ exists: Is $(N_x - M_y)/M$ a function of $y$ only?
    \item Find the integrating factor using the appropriate formula
    \item Multiply the original equation by $\mu$
    \item Verify the new equation is exact
    \item Solve the exact equation using methods from Lesson 22
\end{enumerate}
\end{keypoint}

\section{Important Examples}

\begin{example}[Standard $\mu(x)$ Case]
Solve $(2y + 3x^2)dx + xdy = 0$

\textbf{Step 1:} Test exactness: $M_y = 2$, $N_x = 1$. Not exact!

\textbf{Step 2:} Check for $\mu(x)$:
\[\frac{M_y - N_x}{N} = \frac{2 - 1}{x} = \frac{1}{x}\]
This is a function of $x$ only!

\textbf{Step 3:} Find $\mu(x)$:
\[\mu(x) = e^{\int \frac{1}{x}dx} = e^{\ln|x|} = x\]

\textbf{Step 4:} Multiply by $\mu = x$:
\[(2xy + 3x^3)dx + x^2dy = 0\]

\textbf{Step 5:} Verify exactness: $M_y = 2x$, $N_x = 2x$. ✓

\textbf{Step 6:} Find potential function:
\[H = \int x^2\,dy = x^2y + f(x)\]
\[\frac{\partial H}{\partial x} = 2xy + f'(x) = 2xy + 3x^3\]
\[f'(x) = 3x^3 \Rightarrow f(x) = \frac{3x^4}{4}\]

\textbf{Solution:} $x^2y + \frac{3x^4}{4} = C$
\end{example}

\begin{example}[Linear Equation Connection]
The linear equation $y' + P(x)y = Q(x)$ can be written as:
\[(Py - Q)dx + dy = 0\]

Check for $\mu(x)$:
\[\frac{M_y - N_x}{N} = \frac{P - 0}{1} = P(x)\]

Therefore: $\mu(x) = e^{\int P(x)dx}$ - exactly the integrating factor from Block 5!
\end{example}

\section{Common Patterns to Recognize}

\begin{examtip}
\textbf{Quick Recognition Guide:}
\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{|l|c|c|}
\hline
\textbf{If you see} & \textbf{Try} & \textbf{Integrating Factor} \\
\hline
$N = x^n$ & $\mu(x)$ & Often $\mu = x^k$ \\
$M = y^n$ & $\mu(y)$ & Often $\mu = y^k$ \\
Linear in $y$ & $\mu(x)$ & $\mu = e^{\int P(x)dx}$ \\
Homogeneous & Either & Check both tests \\
$N = f(x)$ only & $\mu(x)$ & Guaranteed to exist \\
$M = g(y)$ only & $\mu(y)$ & Guaranteed to exist \\
\hline
\end{tabular}
\end{center}
\end{examtip}

\section{Memory Aids}

\begin{insight}
\textbf{Mnemonic Devices:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item "$\mu(x)$: My Nexus over N" - $(M_y - N_x)/N$ for $x$ dependence
    \item "$\mu(y)$: Nexus My over M" - $(N_x - M_y)/M$ for $y$ dependence
    \item Notice: Numerators are negatives of each other!
    \item The variable in $\mu$ matches what you divide by (sort of):
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Divide by $N$ (has $x$ in deNominator) $\rightarrow$ $\mu(x)$
        \item Divide by $M$ (has $y$ sound in naMe) $\rightarrow$ $\mu(y)$
    \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
\end{insight}

\section{Verification is Crucial}

\begin{warning}
After finding an integrating factor, ALWAYS:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Multiply the original equation by $\mu$
    \item Verify the new equation is exact by checking $\frac{\partial(\mu M)}{\partial y} = \frac{\partial(\mu N)}{\partial x}$
    \item Only then proceed to find the potential function
\end{enumerate}
Skipping verification is a common source of errors!
\end{warning}

\section*{Solutions and Key Insights}

\textbf{Problem 1:}
(a) $M_y = 2$, $N_x = 1$, not equal → not exact
(b) $(M_y - N_x)/N = (2-1)/x = 1/x$ → $\mu(x)$ exists!
(c) $(N_x - M_y)/M = (1-2)/(3x+2y)$ → contains both $x$ and $y$, no $\mu(y)$
(d) $\mu(x) = e^{\int(1/x)dx} = x$

\textbf{Problem 7:}
Test: $(M_y - N_x)/N = (2x+2y-1)/x = (2x+2y-1)/x$
This contains $y$, so no $\mu(x)$... Wait! Let's recheck:
$M = 2xy + y^2$, $N = x$
$(M_y - N_x)/N = (2x + 2y - 0)/x = 2 + 2y/x$
Still has $y$. Try $\mu(y)$:
$(N_x - M_y)/M = (1 - 2x - 2y)/(2xy + y^2) = -1/y$
So $\mu(y) = e^{\int(-1/y)dy} = 1/y$

\textbf{Problem 19:}
For $(2xy^2 + y)dx + xdy = 0$:
(a) $(M_y - N_x)/N = (4xy + 1 - 1)/x = 4y$ → No $\mu(x)$
Actually, let me recalculate: $M_y = 4xy + 1$, $N_x = 1$
$(M_y - N_x)/N = 4xy/x = 4y$ → No $\mu(x)$
$(N_x - M_y)/M = (1 - 4xy - 1)/(2xy^2 + y) = -4xy/(y(2xy + 1)) = -4x/(2xy + 1)$
Hmm, this is complex. Let me reconsider the original equation...

\textbf{Problem 24:}
$y' + (2/x)y = x^2$ becomes $(2y/x - x^2)dx + dy = 0$
$(M_y - N_x)/N = (2/x - 0)/1 = 2/x$
$\mu(x) = e^{\int(2/x)dx} = e^{2\ln|x|} = x^2$
Multiply: $(2xy - x^4)dx + x^2dy = 0$
Now exact! $H = x^2y - x^5/5$
Solution: $x^2y - x^5/5 = C$ or $y = x^3/5 + C/x^2$

\textbf{Key Strategy:} When both tests give functions of mixed variables, neither $\mu(x)$ nor $\mu(y)$ exists. Move to Lesson 24 for special forms!

\textbf{Warning:} Problem 32 - Counterexample: $2ydx + xdy = 0$ has both types but is not exact!

- **To Block 5:** Linear equations are special case
- **To Block 8:** Some second-order equations reduce to exact

**Study Time Investment:**
- Initial learning: 2.5 hours
- Practice problems: 2 hours
- Method comparison: 1 hour
- Speed training: 0.5 hours
- Total: 6 hours for mastery

**Quick Test to Check Understanding:**
You should be able to:
1. Determine if μ(x) or μ(y) exists in under 2 minutes
2. Find the integrating factor without errors
3. Explain why (My - Nx)/N must be function of x only
4. Connect to linear equation integrating factors
5. Choose the simpler μ when both exist

**Next Steps:**
Once you've mastered μ(x) and μ(y), proceed to Lesson 24 for special integrating factors like μ(xy) and other forms that handle cases where neither simple form exists.
