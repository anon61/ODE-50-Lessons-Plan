# **Lesson 19: Riccati Equations - When You Know One Solution**

## **Component 1: Audio Lesson Script**

Welcome to Lesson 19, where we unlock one of the most beautiful connections in differential equations - the Riccati equation! This is where nonlinear equations meet clever algebra, and knowing just one solution gives you everything.

So basically, a Riccati equation has the form y' = q₀(x) + q₁(x)y + q₂(x)y². Notice anything special? It's got y², making it nonlinear, but it's only quadratic in y. That's the key - it's the simplest genuinely nonlinear equation, sitting right between linear and fully nonlinear.

Here's the magic insight that makes Riccati solvable: if you know just one particular solution y_p, you can find all the others! Why? Because the difference between any two solutions follows a simpler pattern. Let me show you this beautiful trick.

Say y_p is a known solution, so y_p' = q₀ + q₁y_p + q₂y_p². Now, let y = y_p + v, where v is what we're looking for. Substituting into the original equation: (y_p + v)' = q₀ + q₁(y_p + v) + q₂(y_p + v)².

Expanding the right side: y_p' + v' = q₀ + q₁y_p + q₁v + q₂y_p² + 2q₂y_p·v + q₂v².

But wait! Since y_p satisfies the equation, y_p' = q₀ + q₁y_p + q₂y_p². These terms cancel! We're left with: v' = q₁v + 2q₂y_p·v + q₂v².

Factoring: v' = (q₁ + 2q₂y_p)v + q₂v². This is a Bernoulli equation with n = 2! We just turned the impossible Riccati into something we know how to solve!

Let's work through a complete example. Consider y' = 2/x² - 2y/x + y². First, we need to find one solution. For equations with polynomial coefficients, try polynomial solutions. Let's guess y_p = a/x. Then y_p' = -a/x².

Substituting: -a/x² = 2/x² - 2(a/x)/x + (a/x)². This gives: -a/x² = 2/x² - 2a/x² + a²/x². Comparing coefficients: -a = 2 - 2a + a², which gives a² - a + 2 = 0. Solving: a = 2 or a = -1.

Let's use y_p = 2/x. Now substitute y = 2/x + v into the original equation. After the algebra (which you should verify!), we get: v' = (2/x)v + v².

This is Bernoulli with n = 2! Using w = 1/v, we get w' = -2w/x - 1. The integrating factor is x², giving us w = -x/3 + C/x². Therefore, v = 1/(-x/3 + C/x²) = x²/(-x³/3 + C).

The general solution is: y = 2/x + x²/(-x³/3 + C).

Here's a pro tip for finding particular solutions: look for solutions of the same form as the coefficients. If coefficients are polynomials, try polynomial solutions. If they're exponentials, try exponentials. If they're trigonometric, try trig functions.

Common patterns for particular solutions:
- Constant coefficients → try y_p = constant
- Coefficients with 1/x → try y_p = a/x
- Periodic coefficients → try periodic y_p
- Exponential coefficients → try exponential y_p

Professor Ditkowski loves testing this: sometimes the particular solution is y_p = 0 or y_p = -q₁/2q₂ (when these are constants). Always check these first!

Let me show you another example with a different twist. Consider y' = 1 + y². This is Riccati with q₀ = 1, q₁ = 0, q₂ = 1. By inspection (or remembering your trig derivatives), y_p = tan(x) is a solution since tan'(x) = sec²(x) = 1 + tan²(x).

Using y = tan(x) + v, the equation becomes v' = 2tan(x)·v + v². This Bernoulli equation, with substitution w = 1/v, becomes w' = -2tan(x)·w - 1. The solution involves integrating factors with trigonometric functions.

Here's the geometric insight: Riccati equations describe projective transformations. The cross-ratio of four solutions is constant! This deep connection to projective geometry explains why one solution unlocks all others - it's like knowing one point of a projective transformation.

Common mistakes to avoid:
1. Forgetting to verify that y_p actually satisfies the equation
2. Algebraic errors when expanding (y_p + v)²
3. Not recognizing the resulting Bernoulli equation
4. Missing the n = 2 in the Bernoulli substitution

For exams, Prof. Ditkowski often gives hints about the particular solution. Phrases like "verify that y_p = ..." or "given that one solution is..." are your cues. Sometimes he'll ask you to find the particular solution first - that's where trying simple forms pays off.

The connection to second-order linear equations is crucial. Every second-order linear equation u'' + p(x)u' + q(x)u = 0 can be transformed to Riccati via y = -u'/u. Conversely, every Riccati can become second-order linear. This duality appears on exams!

Remember, Riccati equations model everything from optimal control to quantum mechanics. The fact that one solution determines all others is profound - it's like knowing one trajectory determines the entire flow. Master this transformation, and you've mastered one of the most important nonlinear equations in mathematics!

\section{Definition and Recognition}

\begin{definition}[Riccati Equation]
A Riccati differential equation has the form:
$$\frac{dy}{dx} = q_0(x) + q_1(x)y + q_2(x)y^2$$
where $q_0(x)$, $q_1(x)$, and $q_2(x)$ are continuous functions and $q_2(x) \not\equiv 0$.
\end{definition}

\begin{keypoint}
\textbf{Special Cases:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item If $q_2(x) \equiv 0$: Linear equation
    \item If $q_0(x) \equiv 0$: Bernoulli equation with $n = 2$
    \item If $q_1(x) \equiv 0$: Separable after substitution
    \item General case: Requires particular solution or transformation to second-order
\end{itemize}
\end{keypoint}

\section{The Fundamental Transformation}

\begin{theorem}[Riccati to Bernoulli Reduction]
If $y_p(x)$ is a particular solution of the Riccati equation, then the substitution
$$y = y_p + v$$
transforms the Riccati equation into the Bernoulli equation:
$$\frac{dv}{dx} = (q_1 + 2q_2y_p)v + q_2v^2$$
\end{theorem}

\begin{proof}
Given: $y' = q_0 + q_1y + q_2y^2$ and $y_p' = q_0 + q_1y_p + q_2y_p^2$

Substitute $y = y_p + v$:
\begin{align}
y_p' + v' &= q_0 + q_1(y_p + v) + q_2(y_p + v)^2 \\
y_p' + v' &= q_0 + q_1y_p + q_1v + q_2y_p^2 + 2q_2y_pv + q_2v^2 \\
v' &= q_1v + 2q_2y_pv + q_2v^2 \quad \text{(using } y_p' = q_0 + q_1y_p + q_2y_p^2\text{)} \\
v' &= (q_1 + 2q_2y_p)v + q_2v^2 \quad \square
\end{align}
\end{proof}

\begin{transformation}
\textbf{Complete Solution Algorithm:}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Find or verify particular solution $y_p$
    \item Substitute $y = y_p + v$
    \item Obtain Bernoulli equation: $v' = (q_1 + 2q_2y_p)v + q_2v^2$
    \item Use substitution $w = v^{-1}$ (since $n = 2$)
    \item Solve linear equation: $w' = -(q_1 + 2q_2y_p)w - q_2$
    \item Back-substitute: $v = 1/w$, then $y = y_p + v$
\end{enumerate}
\end{transformation}

\section{Finding Particular Solutions}

\begin{method}[Inspection Techniques]
\textbf{Common forms to try:}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Constants:} Try $y_p = c$ when coefficients allow
    \item \textbf{Linear:} Try $y_p = ax + b$ for polynomial coefficients
    \item \textbf{Rational:} Try $y_p = a/x$ or $y_p = a/(x+b)$
    \item \textbf{Exponential:} Try $y_p = ae^{bx}$ for constant coefficients
    \item \textbf{Trigonometric:} Try $y_p = a\tan(bx)$ or $a\cot(bx)$
    \item \textbf{Special:} $y_p = -q_1/(2q_2)$ when this ratio is constant
\end{enumerate}
\end{method}

\begin{example}[Polynomial Particular Solution]
Solve: $y' = \frac{2}{x^2} - \frac{2y}{x} + y^2$

\textbf{Finding $y_p$:} Try $y_p = \frac{a}{x}$
$$-\frac{a}{x^2} = \frac{2}{x^2} - \frac{2a}{x^2} + \frac{a^2}{x^2}$$
$$-a = 2 - 2a + a^2 \implies a^2 - a + 2 = 0$$

This gives $a = 2$ or $a = -1$. Use $y_p = \frac{2}{x}$.

\textbf{Transformation:} Let $y = \frac{2}{x} + v$
$$v' = -\frac{2v}{x} + \frac{4v}{x} + v^2 = \frac{2v}{x} + v^2$$

\textbf{Bernoulli to Linear:} Let $w = v^{-1}$
$$w' = -\frac{2w}{x} - 1$$

\textbf{Solution:} $w = \frac{C}{x^2} - \frac{x}{3}$

\textbf{Final Answer:} $y = \frac{2}{x} + \frac{1}{C/x^2 - x/3}$
\end{example}

\section{Special Riccati Forms}

\begin{insight}
\textbf{Constant Coefficient Riccati:} $y' = a + by + cy^2$
\begin{itemize}
    \item If $b^2 - 4ac > 0$: Two constant particular solutions
    \item If $b^2 - 4ac = 0$: One constant particular solution
    \item If $b^2 - 4ac < 0$: No real constant solutions
\end{itemize}
For $b^2 - 4ac < 0$, try $y_p = \alpha \tan(\beta x)$ where $\beta = \sqrt{4ac - b^2}/(2c)$
\end{insight}

\begin{example}[Trigonometric Particular Solution]
Solve: $y' = 1 + y^2$

\textbf{Observation:} This matches $\frac{d}{dx}[\tan x] = \sec^2 x = 1 + \tan^2 x$

\textbf{Particular solution:} $y_p = \tan x$

\textbf{General solution:} Let $y = \tan x + v$
$$v' = 2\tan x \cdot v + v^2$$

After solving the Bernoulli equation:
$$y = \tan x + \frac{\sin x}{C - \cos x}$$
\end{example}

\section{Connection to Linear Second-Order}

\begin{theorem}[Riccati-Linear Duality]
The Riccati equation $y' = q_0 + q_1y + q_2y^2$ is equivalent to the second-order linear equation:
$$u'' - (q_1 + \frac{q_2'}{q_2})u' + q_0q_2 \cdot u = 0$$
via the transformation $y = -\frac{1}{q_2} \cdot \frac{u'}{u}$
\end{theorem}

\begin{examtip}
\textbf{Prof. Ditkowski's Patterns:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Often provides $y_p$ or strong hints ("verify that...")
    \item Tests connection to Bernoulli reduction
    \item Likes rational particular solutions $y_p = a/x$
    \item May ask for multiple particular solutions
    \item Tests the second-order connection
    \item Partial credit for correct transformation setup
\end{itemize}
\end{examtip}

\section{Geometric Interpretation}

\begin{lemma}[Cross-Ratio Property]
If $y_1, y_2, y_3, y_4$ are four solutions of a Riccati equation, their cross-ratio:
$$\frac{(y_1 - y_3)(y_2 - y_4)}{(y_1 - y_4)(y_2 - y_3)}$$
is constant (independent of $x$).
\end{lemma}

\begin{warning}
\textbf{Common Pitfalls:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Not verifying that $y_p$ satisfies the equation
    \item Sign errors in the transformation to Bernoulli
    \item Forgetting that Bernoulli with $n = 2$ needs $w = v^{-1}$
    \item Missing singular solutions when $v = 0$
\end{itemize}
\end{warning}

\section{Solution Structure}

\begin{keypoint}
\textbf{General Solution Form:}
$$y = y_p + \frac{1}{w(x)}$$
where $w(x)$ satisfies the linear equation:
$$w' + (q_1 + 2q_2y_p)w = -q_2$$

The general solution has the structure:
$$y = y_p + \frac{1}{\phi(x) + C\psi(x)}$$
where $\phi$ and $\psi$ depend on the particular solution chosen.
\end{keypoint}

\section*{Solutions and Hints}

\textbf{Selected Solutions:}

\textbf{Problem 1(a):} Not Riccati (wrong sign on $y^2$ term). Would need $+y^2$.

\textbf{Problem 6(a):} Try constants: $0 = 2 + c - c^2$, so $c^2 - c - 2 = 0$. Thus $c = 2$ or $c = -1$.

\textbf{Problem 7:} With $y = \tan x + v$: $v' = 2\tan x \cdot v + v^2$.
Using $w = 1/v$: $w' = -2\tan x \cdot w - 1$.
Solution: $w = (\cos x)(C - x)$, so $y = \tan x + \frac{1}{(\cos x)(C - x)}$.

\textbf{Problem 12:} With $y = 2/x + v$:
$v' = \frac{2v}{x} + v^2$ (Bernoulli with $n = 2$).
Let $w = 1/v$: $w' = -\frac{2w}{x} - 1$.
Solution: $w = \frac{C}{x^2} - \frac{x}{3}$.

\textbf{Problem 25:} For equilibria: $0 = a + by + cy^2$.
Discriminant $\Delta = b^2 - 4ac$ determines number of equilibria.
Stability: Check $f'(y^*) = b + 2cy^*$.

\textbf{Key Transformation Formulas:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Riccati: $y' = q_0 + q_1y + q_2y^2$
    \item If $y_p$ known: $y = y_p + v$
    \item Bernoulli form: $v' = (q_1 + 2q_2y_p)v + q_2v^2$
    \item Linear form: $w' = -(q_1 + 2q_2y_p)w - q_2$ where $w = 1/v$
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Common Particular Solutions:}
\begin{itemize}

    \item $y = \tanh(ax)$ for $y' = -a^2 + y^2$
\end{itemize}

2. **Rational:** y = a/x for equations with 1/x² terms
3. **Linear:** y = ax + b for polynomial coefficients
4. **Trigonometric:** y = tan(x) for y' = 1 + y²
5. **Special:** y = -q₁/(2q₂) when this is constant

**NotebookLM Query Suggestions:**
- "Why does knowing one solution unlock all solutions for Riccati?"
- "Explain the geometric meaning of the cross-ratio property"
- "How do I quickly find particular solutions by inspection?"
- "What's the connection between Riccati and second-order linear?"
- "Show me the complete transformation for a specific example"
- "Why does the difference of two solutions give Bernoulli?"

**Practice Schedule:**
- **Day 1:** Recognition and finding particular solutions (Problems 1-11)
- **Day 2:** Complete transformation practice (Problems 12-16)
- **Day 3:** Advanced problems and theory (Problems 17-24)
- **Day 4:** Exam-style problems (Problems 25-29)
- **Day 5:** Review all methods, speed practice

**Self-Assessment Checkpoints:**
- [ ] Can identify Riccati equations immediately
- [ ] Know standard particular solutions to try
- [ ] Execute y = y_p + v transformation correctly
- [ ] Recognize resulting Bernoulli has n = 2
- [ ] Remember w = 1/v for Bernoulli with n = 2
- [ ] Can solve complete problems in under 12 minutes
- [ ] Understand connection to second-order linear
- [ ] Can verify particular solutions quickly

**Common Exam Patterns:**
- "Verify that y_p = ... is a solution" → Direct substitution
- "Given one solution..." → Use the transformation immediately
- Rational functions often have y_p = a/x
- Trigonometric Riccati often have tan or cot solutions
- Watch for y = -q₁/(2q₂) as a quick particular solution

**Memory Aids:**
- "Riccati needs a friend" - One solution helps find all
- "Difference makes Bernoulli" - y = y_p + v gives Bernoulli
- "Two means reciprocal" - Bernoulli n = 2 needs w = 1/v
- "Try simple first" - Constants, then rationals, then trig

**Prof. Ditkowski's Specific Tips:**
- He often gives obvious hints about y_p
- Loves rational particular solutions (a/x form)
- Tests the transformation algebra carefully
- May ask about the cross-ratio property
- Partial credit for correct setup even if not fully solved
- Sometimes combines with initial conditions

**Quick Reference Algorithm:**
1. Identify Riccati: y' = q₀ + q₁y + q₂y²
2. Find/verify y_p (try constants, a/x, tan x)
3. Set y = y_p + v
4. Get Bernoulli: v' = (q₁ + 2q₂y_p)v + q₂v²
5. Set w = 1/v (since n = 2)
6. Solve linear: w' = -(q₁ + 2q₂y_p)w - q₂
7. Back-substitute: v = 1/w, then y = y_p + v
