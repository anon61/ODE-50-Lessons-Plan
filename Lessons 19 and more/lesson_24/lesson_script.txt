# **Lesson 24: Special Integrating Factors - μ(xy) and Beyond**

## **Part 1: Audio Lesson Script**

*[Opening with intrigue]*

So you've tested for μ(x) - nope, both variables appear. You've tested for μ(y) - still no luck. Is it game over? Absolutely not! Here's the key insight that separates the pros from the amateurs: there's a whole world of special integrating factors beyond μ(x) and μ(y), and Prof. Ditkowski loves testing these because they require real understanding, not just mechanical computation.

Let me show you the star of today's show: μ(xy). This beauty appears when the integrating factor depends on the product xy. The test is more complex but follows the same logic. We need (∂M/∂y - ∂N/∂x)/(xN - yM) to be a function of xy only. If it is, we've struck gold!

So basically, here's how it works. Let z = xy, so μ = μ(z). Using the chain rule, ∂μ/∂x = μ'(z) · y and ∂μ/∂y = μ'(z) · x. Substituting into our exactness condition and doing some algebra (trust me, it's messy but worth it), we get that magical test formula.

Let's work through a classic example: (y² - xy)dx + (x² - xy)dy = 0. First, check exactness: ∂M/∂y = 2y - x and ∂N/∂x = 2x - y. Not equal - not exact!

Check μ(x): (My - Nx)/N = (2y - x - 2x + y)/(x² - xy) = (3y - 3x)/(x² - xy). This has both x and y - no good.

Check μ(y): (Nx - My)/M = (2x - y - 2y + x)/(y² - xy) = (3x - 3y)/(y² - xy). Again, both variables - no luck.

Now for μ(xy): (My - Nx)/(xN - yM) = (3y - 3x)/(x(x² - xy) - y(y² - xy)) = (3y - 3x)/(x³ - x²y - y³ + xy²) = (3y - 3x)/(x³ - y³ - xy(x - y)) = -3(x - y)/((x - y)(x² + xy + y²) - xy(x - y)) = -3/(x² + 2xy + y²) = -3/(x + y)².

Hmm, this isn't a function of xy either! But wait - notice something interesting? Let me try a different approach. What if μ = 1/(xy)? Let's check: multiply the original equation by 1/(xy): (y/x - 1)dx + (x/y - 1)dy = 0.

Sometimes Prof. Ditkowski gives you hints like "Try μ = x^a y^b" where you need to find a and b. The strategy is to multiply the equation by x^a y^b, apply the exactness condition, and solve for a and b. It's like detective work!

Here's another common form: μ = (x^a y^b)/(x^c + y^c). These show up in homogeneous-type equations that aren't quite homogeneous. The key is recognizing patterns and trying systematic approaches.

My favorite memory device: "When x and y won't separate, try to make them cooperate!" Look for products xy, sums x+y, ratios x/y, or differences x-y in your test expressions.

Other special forms you might encounter:
- μ = x^m y^n (polynomial powers)
- μ = e^(ax+by) (exponential combinations)  
- μ = (ax + by)^n (linear combinations)
- μ = f(x/y) or μ = f(x±y) (functional dependencies)

The beautiful thing about integrating factors is they always exist in theory - Poincaré proved this! The challenge is finding them. For Prof. Ditkowski's exams, he'll usually give you a hint or make the form recognizable.

Pro tip: If none of the standard tests work, sometimes going back to first principles helps. Ask yourself: "What function, when I multiply by it, will make the mixed partials equal?" Sometimes physical intuition or dimensional analysis provides clues.

Final exam strategy: Start with exactness (free points if it works), then try μ(x), then μ(y), then look for special patterns. Even if you can't find μ, showing your systematic approach gets significant partial credit. Remember - finding the integrating factor is an art as much as a science!
