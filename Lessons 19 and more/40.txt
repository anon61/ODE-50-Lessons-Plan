# **Lesson 40: Critical Points and Linearization**

## **Part 1: Audio Lesson Script**

Hey there! Welcome to Lesson 40, where we're diving into one of the most important techniques in differential equations - analyzing nonlinear systems through linearization. This is where things get really interesting because, let's face it, most real-world systems aren't linear!

So basically, here's the big picture: we've spent a lot of time mastering linear systems like ẋ = ax + by and ẏ = cx + dy. But what happens when we encounter something like ẋ = x² - y or ẏ = sin(x) + y³? These nonlinear systems are everywhere - from pendulums to population dynamics to chemical reactions. The brilliant insight is that we can understand their behavior near equilibrium points by approximating them with linear systems!

Let me show you the key concept. A critical point (or equilibrium) is where nothing changes - both ẋ and ẏ equal zero. For a system ẋ = f(x,y) and ẏ = g(x,y), we find critical points by solving f(x₀,y₀) = 0 and g(x₀,y₀) = 0 simultaneously. Here's the crucial insight: near these points, the nonlinear system behaves approximately like a linear system!

Think of it like this - imagine you're looking at a curved surface through a magnifying glass. The closer you zoom in, the flatter it looks. That's exactly what linearization does - it zooms in on the behavior near a critical point until the nonlinear system looks linear.

Now, here's how we actually do it. The magic tool is the Jacobian matrix. At a critical point (x₀,y₀), we compute:
J = [∂f/∂x  ∂f/∂y]
    [∂g/∂x  ∂g/∂y]
evaluated at (x₀,y₀).

This Jacobian becomes the coefficient matrix of our linearized system! So if the original system is nonlinear, the linearized version near (x₀,y₀) is:
ξ̇ = J·ξ, where ξ = (x-x₀, y-y₀) represents small deviations from equilibrium.

Let's work through a concrete example. Consider the system:
ẋ = y
ẏ = -sin(x) - y

This is actually the damped pendulum equation! First, find critical points. Setting both equations to zero: y = 0 and sin(x) = 0. So critical points occur at (nπ, 0) for any integer n.

Let's linearize at the origin (0,0). The Jacobian is:
J = [0      1  ]
    [-cos(x) -1]

At (0,0), cos(0) = 1, so:
J = [0  1]
    [-1 -1]

The eigenvalues are λ = (-1 ± i√3)/2, giving us a stable spiral! This tells us the pendulum spirals into its downward position when slightly disturbed.

But wait - what about the critical point at (π,0)? This represents the pendulum balanced upside down. Here, cos(π) = -1, so:
J = [0  1]
    [1 -1]

The eigenvalues are λ = (-1 ± √5)/2, giving one positive and one negative - that's a saddle point! No wonder it's hard to balance a pendulum upside down!

Here's a common mistake students make with Prof. Ditkowski: forgetting to evaluate the Jacobian AT the critical point. The partial derivatives must be computed first symbolically, THEN evaluated at (x₀,y₀). I've seen so many students lose points for computing J at the wrong point or mixing up the order.

Another key insight - linearization only tells us LOCAL behavior. If the linearized system says "stable node," that means trajectories near the critical point converge to it. But it says nothing about what happens far away! There might be other critical points, limit cycles, or chaotic behavior elsewhere.

Let me give you another example that Prof. Ditkowski loves: competing species models. Consider:
ẋ = x(1 - x - y)
ẏ = y(2 - x - 3y)

Finding critical points requires solving:
x(1 - x - y) = 0
y(2 - x - 3y) = 0

This gives us four critical points: (0,0), (1,0), (0,2/3), and we need to solve the system 1-x-y=0 and 2-x-3y=0 simultaneously for the fourth, giving (1/2, 1/2).

The Jacobian here is:
J = [1-2x-y    -x   ]
    [-y      2-x-6y]

At each critical point, we get different behavior! At (0,0), both species are extinct - this is unstable. At (1,0), only species x survives. At (0,2/3), only species y survives. At (1/2,1/2), we have coexistence - and linearization tells us if it's stable!

Here's my exam tip: Prof. Ditkowski ALWAYS asks you to find ALL critical points. Don't stop after finding one or two. Check systematically - especially look for critical points on the axes and at the origin. Also, when you have transcendental equations like e^x = y, be prepared to either solve graphically or state that exact solutions can't be found analytically.

The memory aid I use: "JFLE" - Jacobian at Fixed point gives Linear behavior near Equilibrium.

Remember, linearization is like a local map - incredibly useful for understanding nearby behavior, but it can't tell you about the global picture. In the next lesson, we'll see exactly when this local information is guaranteed to be accurate with the Hartman-Grobman theorem!

\section{Introduction to Nonlinear Systems}

\begin{definition}[Nonlinear Autonomous System]
A two-dimensional nonlinear autonomous system has the form:
\begin{align}
\dot{x} &= f(x,y) \\
\dot{y} &= g(x,y)
\end{align}
where $f$ and $g$ are continuously differentiable nonlinear functions.
\end{definition}

\begin{keypoint}
Unlike linear systems where solutions can be found explicitly using eigenvalues and eigenvectors, nonlinear systems generally cannot be solved in closed form. Linearization provides a powerful tool to understand local behavior.
\end{keypoint}

\section{Critical Points}

\begin{definition}[Critical Point/Equilibrium]
A point $(x_0, y_0)$ is a critical point (or equilibrium point) of the system if:
$$f(x_0, y_0) = 0 \quad \text{and} \quad g(x_0, y_0) = 0$$
\end{definition}

\begin{method}[Finding Critical Points]
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Set $f(x,y) = 0$ and $g(x,y) = 0$
    \item Solve the resulting algebraic system
    \item Check each solution for validity
    \item List all critical points systematically
\end{enumerate}
\end{method}

\begin{warning}
Nonlinear systems can have:
\begin{itemize}
    \item No critical points
    \item Finitely many critical points (most common)
    \item Infinitely many critical points (degenerate cases)
\end{itemize}
Always verify you've found ALL critical points!
\end{warning}

\section{The Jacobian Matrix}

\begin{definition}[Jacobian Matrix]
For the system $\dot{x} = f(x,y)$, $\dot{y} = g(x,y)$, the Jacobian matrix is:
$$J(x,y) = \begin{pmatrix}
\frac{\partial f}{\partial x} & \frac{\partial f}{\partial y} \\[8pt]
\frac{\partial g}{\partial x} & \frac{\partial g}{\partial y}
\end{pmatrix}$$
\end{definition}

\begin{jacobian}
\textbf{Critical Computation Rule:}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Compute partial derivatives \textit{symbolically}
    \item \textit{Then} evaluate at the critical point $(x_0, y_0)$
    \item The result $J(x_0, y_0)$ is a constant matrix
\end{enumerate}
\end{jacobian}

\section{Linearization Process}

\begin{theorem}[Linearization near Equilibrium]
Near a critical point $(x_0, y_0)$, the nonlinear system can be approximated by the linear system:
$$\begin{pmatrix} \dot{\xi} \\ \dot{\eta} \end{pmatrix} = J(x_0, y_0) \begin{pmatrix} \xi \\ \eta \end{pmatrix}$$
where $\xi = x - x_0$ and $\eta = y - y_0$ represent small deviations from equilibrium.
\end{theorem}

\begin{insight}
The linearization is derived from the Taylor expansion:
\begin{align}
f(x,y) &= f(x_0,y_0) + \frac{\partial f}{\partial x}\bigg|_{(x_0,y_0)}(x-x_0) + \frac{\partial f}{\partial y}\bigg|_{(x_0,y_0)}(y-y_0) + \text{h.o.t.} \\
&= 0 + \text{linear terms} + \text{higher order terms}
\end{align}
Near the critical point, higher order terms are negligible!
\end{insight}

\section{Classification of Critical Points}

\begin{method}[Classification Procedure]
Given a critical point $(x_0, y_0)$:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Compute $J(x_0, y_0)$
    \item Find eigenvalues $\lambda_1, \lambda_2$ of $J(x_0, y_0)$
    \item Classify using:
\end{enumerate}
\end{method}

\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{|l|l|l|}
\hline
\textbf{Eigenvalues} & \textbf{Type} & \textbf{Stability} \\
\hline
$\lambda_1, \lambda_2 < 0$ (real) & Node & Asymptotically stable \\
$\lambda_1, \lambda_2 > 0$ (real) & Node & Unstable \\
$\lambda_1 < 0 < \lambda_2$ (real) & Saddle & Unstable \\
$\lambda = \alpha \pm i\beta$, $\alpha < 0$ & Spiral & Asymptotically stable \\
$\lambda = \alpha \pm i\beta$, $\alpha > 0$ & Spiral & Unstable \\
$\lambda = \pm i\beta$ (pure imaginary) & Center & Linearization inconclusive \\
\hline
\end{tabular}
\end{center}

\begin{examtip}
Prof. Ditkowski expects you to:
\begin{itemize}
    \item State the type (node, saddle, spiral, center)
    \item State stability (stable, unstable, or inconclusive)
    \item Show eigenvalue computation explicitly
\end{itemize}
\end{examtip}

\section{Complete Examples}

\begin{example}[Van der Pol Oscillator]
Consider the system:
\begin{align}
\dot{x} &= y \\
\dot{y} &= -x + \mu(1-x^2)y
\end{align}
where $\mu > 0$ is a parameter.

\textbf{Step 1:} Find critical points\\
Setting $y = 0$ and $-x + \mu(1-x^2) \cdot 0 = -x = 0$ gives $(0,0)$ as the only critical point.

\textbf{Step 2:} Compute Jacobian
$$J(x,y) = \begin{pmatrix} 0 & 1 \\ -1 - 2\mu xy & \mu(1-x^2) \end{pmatrix}$$

\textbf{Step 3:} Evaluate at $(0,0)$
$$J(0,0) = \begin{pmatrix} 0 & 1 \\ -1 & \mu \end{pmatrix}$$

\textbf{Step 4:} Find eigenvalues\\
Characteristic equation: $\lambda^2 - \mu\lambda + 1 = 0$\\
Eigenvalues: $\lambda = \frac{\mu \pm \sqrt{\mu^2 - 4}}{2}$

\textbf{Step 5:} Classification
\begin{itemize}
    \item If $0 < \mu < 2$: Complex with positive real part $\Rightarrow$ Unstable spiral
    \item If $\mu = 2$: Repeated positive eigenvalue $\Rightarrow$ Unstable node
    \item If $\mu > 2$: Two positive real eigenvalues $\Rightarrow$ Unstable node
\end{itemize}
\end{example}

\section{Validity of Linearization}

\begin{warning}
Linearization provides accurate local behavior EXCEPT when:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Eigenvalues have zero real part (centers, degenerate nodes)
    \item The system has special symmetries
    \item Nonlinear terms dominate near the critical point
\end{itemize}
\end{warning}

\begin{insight}
The region where linearization is valid shrinks as:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Eigenvalues approach the imaginary axis
    \item Nonlinearity becomes stronger
    \item Other critical points are nearby
\end{itemize}
\end{insight}

    block/.style = {draw, rectangle, minimum height=2em, minimum width=8em},
    decision/.style = {draw, diamond, aspect=2},
