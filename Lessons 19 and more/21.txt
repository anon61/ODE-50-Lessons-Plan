# **Lesson 21: Exact Equations - Theory and Recognition**

## **Part 1: Audio Lesson Script**

*[Opening with conversational tone]*

Hey there! So basically, we're diving into one of the most elegant topics in differential equations - exact equations. Here's the key insight that'll change how you see these problems: imagine you're hiking on a mountain, and the altitude at any point is given by some function H(x,y). Now, if you walk along a contour line - you know, those lines on a topographic map where the altitude stays constant - you're actually tracing out the solution to an exact differential equation! Pretty cool, right?

Let me show you what's really happening here. An exact equation looks like M(x,y)dx + N(x,y)dy = 0, and the magic happens when this expression is literally the total differential of some function H. Think about it - when you learned partial derivatives, you saw that dH = (∂H/∂x)dx + (∂H/∂y)dy. So if M = ∂H/∂x and N = ∂H/∂y, then our equation is just saying dH = 0, which means H is constant along solution curves!

Now here's the million-dollar question Prof. Ditkowski ALWAYS asks: how do we know if an equation is exact? The answer comes from that beautiful theorem you learned in multivariable calculus - if the mixed partial derivatives are continuous, they're equal! So ∂²H/∂y∂x = ∂²H/∂x∂y. But wait - if M = ∂H/∂x, then ∂M/∂y = ∂²H/∂y∂x. And if N = ∂H/∂y, then ∂N/∂x = ∂²H/∂x∂y. So the exactness test is simply: ∂M/∂y = ∂N/∂x.

Let me walk you through a basic example. Consider (2xy + 3x²)dx + (x² + 2y)dy = 0. First thing - identify M and N. We have M = 2xy + 3x² and N = x² + 2y. Now let's test for exactness. We compute ∂M/∂y = 2x and ∂N/∂x = 2x. They're equal! So this equation is exact.

Here's a common mistake students make - they forget that the equation needs to be in the exact form first. If you see something like dy/dx = -M/N, you need to rewrite it as Mdx + Ndy = 0 before testing for exactness. Prof. Ditkowski deducts points if you don't show this step explicitly!

Now let's try a trickier one that shows up on exams. Consider (3x²y + y³)dx + (x³ + 3xy² + y²)dy = 0. Here M = 3x²y + y³ and N = x³ + 3xy² + y². Let's check: ∂M/∂y = 3x² + 3y² and ∂N/∂x = 3x² + 3y². Perfect match! It's exact.

But what if they don't match? Try (2xy)dx + (3x²y)dy = 0. We get ∂M/∂y = 2x and ∂N/∂x = 6xy. These aren't equal, so the equation is NOT exact. This is where integrating factors come in - but that's next lesson's adventure!

Here's a memory device I love: think "My Nexus" - M with respect to y, N with respect to x. If My equals Nx, you've got exactness!

The physical interpretation is beautiful. In thermodynamics, exact differentials represent state functions - properties that depend only on the current state, not the path taken. Internal energy, entropy, enthalpy - all exact differentials. Work and heat? Not exact - they're path-dependent. This connection shows up in Prof. Ditkowski's applied problems.

Warning! Domain matters. The exactness condition only guarantees a potential function exists locally. If your domain has holes, like the punctured plane (plane minus the origin), global potential functions might not exist. The classic example is the equation (-y dx + x dy)/(x² + y²) = 0, which is exact everywhere except the origin, but has no single-valued potential function on the entire punctured plane.

For the exam, here's your systematic approach: First, identify M and N clearly. Second, compute both partial derivatives ∂M/∂y and ∂N/∂x - show every step! Third, explicitly state whether they're equal. Fourth, conclude with "Therefore, the equation is/is not exact." This structure gets you full marks even if you make a small calculation error.

So basically, exact equations are about recognizing when a differential equation is secretly telling you that some function H stays constant. The test is beautifully simple - just check if those mixed partials match. Master this recognition, and you're halfway to solving these equations!

\section{Introduction to Exact Equations}

\begin{definition}[Exact Differential Equation]
A first-order differential equation of the form
\[M(x,y)dx + N(x,y)dy = 0\]
is called \textbf{exact} if there exists a function $H(x,y)$ such that
\[dH = \frac{\partial H}{\partial x}dx + \frac{\partial H}{\partial y}dy = M(x,y)dx + N(x,y)dy\]
\end{definition}

\begin{keypoint}
When an equation is exact, its solution curves are the level curves $H(x,y) = C$ of the potential function $H$.
\end{keypoint}

\section{The Exactness Criterion}

\begin{theorem}[Test for Exactness]
Let $M(x,y)$ and $N(x,y)$ have continuous partial derivatives in a simply connected domain $D$. The equation $M(x,y)dx + N(x,y)dy = 0$ is exact if and only if
\[\boxed{\frac{\partial M}{\partial y} = \frac{\partial N}{\partial x}}\]
\end{theorem}

\begin{proof}
($\Rightarrow$) If the equation is exact, then $M = \frac{\partial H}{\partial x}$ and $N = \frac{\partial H}{\partial y}$ for some $H$. By Schwarz's theorem:
\[\frac{\partial M}{\partial y} = \frac{\partial^2 H}{\partial y \partial x} = \frac{\partial^2 H}{\partial x \partial y} = \frac{\partial N}{\partial x}\]

($\Leftarrow$) The converse requires constructing $H$ from the condition, shown in Lesson 22.
\end{proof}

\section{Geometric Interpretation}

\begin{insight}
The vector field $\mathbf{F} = (M, N)$ is conservative (has a potential function) if and only if its curl vanishes:
\[\text{curl}(\mathbf{F}) = \frac{\partial N}{\partial x} - \frac{\partial M}{\partial y} = 0\]
\end{insight}

\end{tikzpicture}

\section{Connection to Physics}

\begin{keypoint}
In thermodynamics, exact differentials correspond to state functions:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Internal Energy: $dU = TdS - PdV$ (exact)
    \item Enthalpy: $dH = TdS + VdP$ (exact)
    \item Work: $\delta W = PdV$ (not exact - path dependent)
    \item Heat: $\delta Q = TdS$ (not exact - path dependent)
\end{itemize}
\end{keypoint}

\section{Algorithm for Testing Exactness}

\begin{algorithm}
\textbf{Step-by-Step Exactness Test:}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Write equation in standard form: $M(x,y)dx + N(x,y)dy = 0$
    \item Identify $M(x,y)$ and $N(x,y)$ explicitly
    \item Compute $\frac{\partial M}{\partial y}$ (show all steps)
    \item Compute $\frac{\partial N}{\partial x}$ (show all steps)
    \item Compare the results:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item If equal $\Rightarrow$ equation is exact
        \item If not equal $\Rightarrow$ equation is not exact
    \end{itemize}
    \item State conclusion explicitly
\end{enumerate}
\end{algorithm}

\section{Common Forms and Patterns}

\begin{examtip}
Recognize these patterns that often appear in Prof. Ditkowski's exams:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Polynomial Forms:} $(ax^ny^m + bx^py^q)dx + (cx^ry^s + dx^ty^u)dy = 0$
    \item \textbf{Exponential Forms:} $(ae^{x+y} + bx)dx + (ce^{x+y} + dy)dy = 0$
    \item \textbf{Trigonometric:} $(\cos(xy) \cdot y + f(x))dx + (\cos(xy) \cdot x + g(y))dy = 0$
    \item \textbf{Mixed:} $(x^2y + \sin x)dx + (x^3/3 + e^y)dy = 0$
\end{enumerate}
\end{examtip}

\section{Domain Considerations}

\begin{warning}
The exactness condition guarantees existence of a potential function only in simply connected domains. Watch for:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Punctured plane: $\mathbb{R}^2 \setminus \{(0,0)\}$
    \item Domains with holes or discontinuities
    \item Multi-valued potential functions
\end{itemize}
\end{warning}

\section{Quick Reference}

\hline
\end{tabular}
\end{center}

\section*{Solutions and Hints}

\textbf{Problem 1:} $M = 2x + 3y$, $N = 3x + 4y$.
$\frac{\partial M}{\partial y} = 3$, $\frac{\partial N}{\partial x} = 3$.
Equal $\Rightarrow$ Exact!

\textbf{Problem 2:} $M = y^2 + 2xy$, $N = 2xy - x^2$.
$\frac{\partial M}{\partial y} = 2y + 2x$, $\frac{\partial N}{\partial x} = 2y - 2x$.
Not equal $\Rightarrow$ Not exact.

\textbf{Problem 6:} Multiply by denominator: $(2xy + 1)dx + (x^2 + 2y)dy = 0$.
$M = 2xy + 1$, $N = x^2 + 2y$.
$\frac{\partial M}{\partial y} = 2x$, $\frac{\partial N}{\partial x} = 2x$.
Equal $\Rightarrow$ Exact!

\textbf{Problem 15:} For exactness: $\frac{\partial M}{\partial y} = kx + 3y^2 = \frac{\partial N}{\partial x} = 2x + 3y^2$.
Therefore $k = 2$.

\textbf{Problem 21:} $M = -y/(x^2+y^2)$, $N = x/(x^2+y^2)$.
$\frac{\partial M}{\partial y} = \frac{y^2-x^2}{(x^2+y^2)^2}$,
$\frac{\partial N}{\partial x} = \frac{y^2-x^2}{(x^2+y^2)^2}$.
Exact everywhere except origin! But no single-valued potential on punctured plane.

\textbf{Key Insight for Problem 27:} $Q'(y) = 0$ and $R'(x) = 0$.
