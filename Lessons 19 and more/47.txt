**Opening**

So basically, we've saved the best for last in this block. Euler-Cauchy equations - also called equidimensional equations - are the perfect bridge between constant and variable coefficient ODEs. They look scary with all those t's multiplying derivatives, but here's the secret: they're just constant coefficient equations in disguise. Today I'll show you two methods to solve them, and you'll see why Prof. Ditkowski loves putting these on exams.

The beautiful thing about Euler equations is their scaling property. If you stretch or compress the independent variable by a factor, the equation maintains its form. This makes them natural for problems with geometric similarity - like heat flow in circular regions, vibrations of conical structures, or any problem where the physics scales with distance from a point.

**The Euler-Cauchy Equation**

The general n-th order Euler equation looks like:
t^n y^(n) + a_(n-1) t^(n-1) y^(n-1) + ... + a_1 t y' + a_0 y = 0

For second-order (the most common):
t²y'' + aty' + by = 0

where a and b are constants. Notice how the power of t matches the order of the derivative? That's the key pattern.

**Method 1: The Power Solution (Direct Approach)**

Here's the insight that makes everything work: Try y = t^r for some constant r.

Why? Because:
- y = t^r
- y' = rt^(r-1)
- y'' = r(r-1)t^(r-2)

Substituting into t²y'' + aty' + by = 0:
t² · r(r-1)t^(r-2) + at · rt^(r-1) + b · t^r = 0
r(r-1)t^r + art^r + bt^r = 0
t^r[r(r-1) + ar + b] = 0

Since t^r ≠ 0 (for t > 0), we need:
r(r-1) + ar + b = 0
r² + (a-1)r + b = 0

This is the characteristic equation for the Euler equation! It's algebraic, just like for constant coefficients.

**Example 1: Distinct Real Roots**

Solve: t²y'' - 3ty' + 4y = 0 for t > 0.

Assuming y = t^r:
r(r-1) - 3r + 4 = 0
r² - r - 3r + 4 = 0
r² - 4r + 4 = 0
(r - 2)² = 0

Wait, that's a repeated root! Let me redo with a better example.

Actually, let's do: t²y'' - 3ty' + 3y = 0

r(r-1) - 3r + 3 = 0
r² - r - 3r + 3 = 0
r² - 4r + 3 = 0
(r - 1)(r - 3) = 0

So r₁ = 1 and r₂ = 3.

General solution: y = c₁t + c₂t³

See how clean that is? Powers of t, just like we guessed!

**Case 2: Repeated Roots**

Now let's go back to t²y'' - 3ty' + 4y = 0.

We got (r - 2)² = 0, so r = 2 is a double root.

Just like with constant coefficients and repeated roots, we need a second solution. By analogy (or by reduction of order), the second solution is t²ln(t).

General solution: y = (c₁ + c₂ln(t))t²

The pattern is:
- Single root r: solution is t^r
- Double root r: solutions are t^r and t^r ln(t)
- Triple root r: solutions are t^r, t^r ln(t), and t^r (ln(t))²

**Case 3: Complex Roots**

Solve: t²y'' - ty' + 5y = 0

Characteristic equation:
r(r-1) - r + 5 = 0
r² - 2r + 5 = 0
r = (2 ± √(4-20))/2 = (2 ± 4i)/2 = 1 ± 2i

For complex roots α ± iβ, the real solutions are:
t^α cos(β ln(t)) and t^α sin(β ln(t))

So our solution is:
y = t[c₁cos(2ln(t)) + c₂sin(2ln(t))]

This represents oscillation on a logarithmic scale - pretty wild!

**Method 2: Change of Variables (The Transform Method)**

Here's the elegant approach that reveals the deep structure. Let x = ln(t), so t = e^x.

If y is a function of t, and we define v(x) = y(t) = y(e^x), then:

dy/dt = (dy/dx)(dx/dt) = (1/t)(dv/dx)

So: t(dy/dt) = dv/dx

For the second derivative (this is trickier):
d²y/dt² = d/dt[(1/t)(dv/dx)]
= -(1/t²)(dv/dx) + (1/t²)(d²v/dx²)
= (1/t²)[d²v/dx² - dv/dx]

So: t²(d²y/dt²) = d²v/dx² - dv/dx

**The Magic Transformation**

For the Euler equation t²y'' + aty' + by = 0:
- Replace t²y'' with v'' - v'
- Replace ty' with v'
- Replace y with v

We get:
(v'' - v') + av' + bv = 0
v'' + (a-1)v' + bv = 0

That's a constant coefficient equation in v(x)!

**Example: Using the Transform**

Consider t²y'' + 2ty' - 6y = 0.

After transformation: v'' + (2-1)v' - 6v = 0
So: v'' + v' - 6v = 0

Characteristic equation: λ² + λ - 6 = 0
Factor: (λ + 3)(λ - 2) = 0
Roots: λ = -3, 2

Solution in x: v(x) = c₁e^(-3x) + c₂e^(2x)

Transform back using x = ln(t):
y(t) = c₁e^(-3ln(t)) + c₂e^(2ln(t))
= c₁t^(-3) + c₂t²

Same answer as the direct method!

**Why Prof. Ditkowski Loves These**

Euler equations appear everywhere in physics and engineering:

1. **Radial problems in cylindrical/spherical coordinates**: The radial part of Laplace's equation becomes an Euler equation.

2. **Self-similar solutions**: Any PDE that admits scaling symmetry often reduces to an Euler ODE.

3. **Financial mathematics**: The Black-Scholes equation for options pricing transforms to an Euler equation.

**Example: The Full Treatment**

Let's solve t²y'' + 3ty' + y = 0 completely.

Method 1 (Direct):
r(r-1) + 3r + 1 = 0
r² - r + 3r + 1 = 0
r² + 2r + 1 = 0
(r + 1)² = 0

Double root at r = -1.
Solution: y = (c₁ + c₂ln(t))/t

Method 2 (Transform):
v'' + (3-1)v' + v = 0
v'' + 2v' + v = 0
(λ + 1)² = 0

Double root at λ = -1.
v = (c₁ + c₂x)e^(-x)
y = (c₁ + c₂ln(t))e^(-ln(t)) = (c₁ + c₂ln(t))/t

Perfect match!

**Common Mistakes**

1. **Domain issues**: Euler equations behave differently for t > 0 and t < 0. Usually, we work with t > 0.

2. **Forgetting the ln(t) for repeated roots**: Just like constant coefficients need t for repeated roots, Euler equations need ln(t).

3. **Complex roots formula**: Remember it's t^α[cos(β ln t), sin(β ln t)], not regular trig functions.

4. **Wrong characteristic equation**: The equation is r(r-1) + ar + b = 0, not r² + ar + b = 0. That (r-1) is crucial!

**Memory Technique**

Think "powers match powers":
- t² with y'' → power 2 matches order 2
- t with y' → power 1 matches order 1
- No t with y → power 0 matches order 0

For the characteristic equation: "r chooses r-1" (like combinations) plus the obvious terms.

**Connection to Series Solutions**

Here's something beautiful: Euler equations are exactly the equations where the Frobenius method gives you a simple indicial equation. The roots of our characteristic equation are the indices in the series solution!

This is why Euler equations are the gateway to more general series methods - they're the simplest equations with a regular singular point (at t = 0).

**Exam Strategy**

When you see an Euler equation:

1. **Quick identification**: Powers of t match derivative orders
2. **Choose method**:
   - Direct (t^r) for simple cases
   - Transform (x = ln t) if you prefer constant coefficients
3. **Write characteristic equation carefully**: r(r-1) + ar + b = 0
4. **Handle all cases**:
   - Distinct real → t^(r₁), t^(r₂)
   - Repeated → t^r, t^r ln(t)
   - Complex → t^α cos(β ln t), t^α sin(β ln t)

**Closing**

So basically, Euler equations look intimidating but they're sheep in wolves' clothing - just constant coefficient equations wearing a logarithmic disguise. Master both methods - the direct power approach for speed, and the transformation for understanding. Prof. Ditkowski will definitely include at least one on your exam, often combined with initial conditions or as part of a larger problem. They're the perfect test of whether you really understand the structure underlying all our solution methods.

\maketitle

\section{Introduction}

\begin{definition}[Euler-Cauchy Equation]
An $n$-th order Euler-Cauchy equation (also called an equidimensional equation) has the form:
$$t^n y^{(n)} + a_{n-1} t^{n-1} y^{(n-1)} + \cdots + a_1 t y' + a_0 y = 0$$
where $a_0, a_1, \ldots, a_{n-1}$ are constants and $t \neq 0$.
\end{definition}

\begin{keypoint}
The defining characteristic: the power of $t$ equals the order of the derivative in each term. This creates a scaling symmetry that makes these equations solvable by elementary methods.
\end{keypoint}

\section{Method 1: Power Function Ansatz}

\begin{theorem}[Power Solutions]
For the Euler equation, solutions have the form $y = t^r$ where $r$ satisfies an algebraic characteristic equation.
\end{theorem}

\subsection{Second-Order Case}

Consider the second-order Euler equation:
$$t^2 y'' + a t y' + b y = 0, \quad t > 0$$

\begin{method}[Direct Solution Method]
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Assume $y = t^r$ for some constant $r$
    \item Compute derivatives:
    \begin{align}
    y &= t^r \\
    y' &= r t^{r-1} \\
    y'' &= r(r-1) t^{r-2}
    \end{align}
    \item Substitute into the equation:
    $$t^2 \cdot r(r-1)t^{r-2} + at \cdot rt^{r-1} + b \cdot t^r = 0$$
    \item Simplify:
    $$t^r[r(r-1) + ar + b] = 0$$
    \item Since $t^r \neq 0$ for $t > 0$, we get the characteristic equation:
    $$r^2 + (a-1)r + b = 0$$
\end{enumerate}
\end{method}

\begin{formula}
\textbf{Characteristic Equation for Second-Order Euler:}
$$\boxed{r(r-1) + ar + b = 0 \quad \text{or} \quad r^2 + (a-1)r + b = 0}$$
\end{formula}

\subsection{Solution Forms Based on Roots}

\begin{theorem}[Complete Solution Classification]
Let $r_1, r_2$ be roots of the characteristic equation. Then:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Distinct real roots}: $y = c_1 t^{r_1} + c_2 t^{r_2}$
    \item \textbf{Repeated real root} $r$: $y = (c_1 + c_2 \ln t) t^r$
    \item \textbf{Complex roots} $r = \alpha \pm i\beta$:
    $$y = t^\alpha [c_1 \cos(\beta \ln t) + c_2 \sin(\beta \ln t)]$$
\end{enumerate}
\end{theorem}

\begin{proof}[Proof of Repeated Root Case]
When $r$ is a repeated root, we use reduction of order. Given $y_1 = t^r$, we seek $y_2 = v(t) \cdot t^r$.

The Euler equation in standard form:
$$y'' + \frac{a}{t}y' + \frac{b}{t^2}y = 0$$

Using the reduction formula with $p(t) = a/t$:
$$v = \int \frac{e^{-\int (a/t) dt}}{t^{2r}} dt = \int \frac{t^{-a}}{t^{2r}} dt$$

For a repeated root, $r = (1-a)/2$, so $2r = 1-a$. Thus:
$$v = \int \frac{t^{-a}}{t^{1-a}} dt = \int \frac{1}{t} dt = \ln t$$

Therefore, $y_2 = t^r \ln t$.
\end{proof}

\section{Method 2: Logarithmic Transformation}

\begin{theorem}[Transformation to Constant Coefficients]
The substitution $x = \ln t$ (equivalently, $t = e^x$) transforms an Euler equation into a constant coefficient equation.
\end{theorem}

\subsection{Derivative Transformations}

\begin{lemma}[Change of Variables]
Under the substitution $x = \ln t$, if $v(x) = y(t)$:
\begin{align}
t \frac{dy}{dt} &= \frac{dv}{dx} \\
t^2 \frac{d^2y}{dt^2} &= \frac{d^2v}{dx^2} - \frac{dv}{dx} \\
t^3 \frac{d^3y}{dt^3} &= \frac{d^3v}{dx^3} - 3\frac{d^2v}{dx^2} + 2\frac{dv}{dx}
\end{align}
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}[Proof for Second Derivative]
Using the chain rule:
$$\frac{dy}{dt} = \frac{dv}{dx} \cdot \frac{dx}{dt} = \frac{1}{t} \frac{dv}{dx}$$

For the second derivative:
$$\frac{d^2y}{dt^2} = \frac{d}{dt}\left(\frac{1}{t} \frac{dv}{dx}\right) = -\frac{1}{t^2}\frac{dv}{dx} + \frac{1}{t} \frac{d}{dt}\left(\frac{dv}{dx}\right)$$

Since $\frac{d}{dt}\left(\frac{dv}{dx}\right) = \frac{d^2v}{dx^2} \cdot \frac{dx}{dt} = \frac{1}{t}\frac{d^2v}{dx^2}$:

$$\frac{d^2y}{dt^2} = \frac{1}{t^2}\left(\frac{d^2v}{dx^2} - \frac{dv}{dx}\right)$$
\end{proof}

\subsection{The Transformed Equation}

\begin{theorem}[Constant Coefficient Form]
The Euler equation $t^2y'' + aty' + by = 0$ becomes:
$$v'' + (a-1)v' + bv = 0$$
where $v(x) = y(e^x)$ and $x = \ln t$.
\end{theorem}

\begin{insight}
The characteristic polynomial of the transformed equation is identical to the characteristic equation from the direct method! This confirms the deep connection between the two approaches.
\end{insight}

\section{Higher-Order Euler Equations}

\begin{theorem}[General $n$-th Order]
For the $n$-th order Euler equation, assume $y = t^r$. The characteristic equation is:
$$\prod_{k=0}^{n-1}(r-k) + \sum_{j=1}^{n-1} a_j \prod_{k=0}^{j-1}(r-k) + a_0 = 0$$
\end{theorem}

\begin{example}[Third-Order]
For $t^3y''' + at^2y'' + bty' + cy = 0$:

Assuming $y = t^r$:
- $y' = rt^{r-1}$
- $y'' = r(r-1)t^{r-2}$
- $y''' = r(r-1)(r-2)t^{r-3}$

Characteristic equation:
$$r(r-1)(r-2) + ar(r-1) + br + c = 0$$
\end{example}

\section{Important Special Cases}

\subsection{The Cauchy-Euler Equation}

\begin{definition}[Standard Cauchy-Euler]
The equation $t^2y'' + ty' + (\lambda^2 t^2 + \nu^2)y = 0$ appears in many applications, especially in Bessel function theory.
\end{definition}

\subsection{Modified Euler Equations}

\begin{example}[Shifted Center]
For equations centered at $t = t_0$:
$$(t-t_0)^2 y'' + a(t-t_0)y' + by = 0$$
Use the substitution $s = t - t_0$ first.
\end{example}

\section{Solution Strategies}

\begin{method}[Complete Solution Process]
\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Identify}: Check if powers match derivatives
    \item \textbf{Choose domain}: Usually $t > 0$
    \item \textbf{Select method}:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Direct ($y = t^r$) for straightforward cases
        \item Transform ($x = \ln t$) for complex or higher-order
    \end{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Find characteristic equation}
    \item \textbf{Solve for roots}
    \item \textbf{Build solution} based on root types:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Real distinct: $t^{r_1}, t^{r_2}, \ldots$
        \item Real repeated: $t^r, t^r\ln t, t^r(\ln t)^2, \ldots$
        \item Complex: $t^\alpha\cos(\beta\ln t), t^\alpha\sin(\beta\ln t)$
    \end{itemize}
\end{enumerate}
\end{method}

\section{Applications}

\begin{insight}
Euler equations arise naturally in:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Radial symmetry}: Solutions to Laplace's equation in polar/spherical coordinates
    \item \textbf{Self-similar solutions}: PDEs with scaling symmetry
    \item \textbf{Power-law media}: Heat conduction in materials with power-law properties
    \item \textbf{Financial mathematics}: Option pricing models
    \item \textbf{Fractal geometry}: Equations on self-similar domains
\end{enumerate}
\end{insight}

\section{Connection to Other Topics}

\subsection{Series Solutions}

\begin{theorem}[Frobenius Connection]
The point $t = 0$ is a regular singular point of the Euler equation. The indicial equation from the Frobenius method is exactly our characteristic equation.
\end{theorem}

\subsection{Relationship to Constant Coefficients}

\begin{keypoint}
\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{|l|l|}
\hline
\textbf{Constant Coefficient} & \textbf{Euler Equation} \\
\hline
$y = e^{rt}$ ansatz & $y = t^r$ ansatz \\
\hline
Repeated root gives $te^{rt}$ & Repeated root gives $t^r\ln t$ \\
\hline
Complex roots give $e^{\alpha t}\sin(\beta t)$ & Complex roots give $t^\alpha\sin(\beta\ln t)$ \\
\hline
Linear time scale & Logarithmic time scale \\
\hline
\end{tabular}
\end{center}
\end{keypoint}

\section{Common Pitfalls}

\begin{warning}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Domain}: Solutions differ for $t > 0$ and $t < 0$
    \item \textbf{Characteristic equation}: It's $r(r-1) + ar + b$, not $r^2 + ar + b$
    \item \textbf{Complex roots}: Arguments are $\beta\ln t$, not $\beta t$
    \item \textbf{At $t = 0$}: This is a singular point; solutions may not extend through it
    \item \textbf{Initial conditions}: Often given at $t = 1$ to avoid the singularity
\end{enumerate}
\end{warning}

\begin{examtip}
Prof. Ditkowski often combines Euler equations with:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Initial value problems at $t = 1$
    \item Boundary value problems on $[1, e]$
    \item Questions about solution behavior as $t \to 0^+$ or $t \to \infty$
    \item Transformation to constant coefficients
\end{itemize}
\end{examtip}

\section{Summary Table}

\begin{formula}
\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|}
\hline
\textbf{Equation} & \textbf{Characteristic Eq.} & \textbf{Solutions} \\
\hline
$t^2y'' + aty' + by = 0$ & $r^2 + (a-1)r + b = 0$ & Based on roots \\
\hline
Distinct real $r_1, r_2$ & -- & $c_1t^{r_1} + c_2t^{r_2}$ \\
\hline
Repeated root $r$ & -- & $(c_1 + c_2\ln t)t^r$ \\
\hline
Complex $\alpha \pm i\beta$ & -- & $t^\alpha[c_1\cos(\beta\ln t) + c_2\sin(\beta\ln t)]$ \\

\subsection*{Part D: Using the Transform Method}

\begin{enumerate}[resume]
\item Let $x = \ln t$, $v(x) = y(t)$\\
Transform: $v'' - 5v' + 6v = 0$\\
Characteristic: $\lambda^2 - 5\lambda + 6 = 0$\\

\end{enumerate}

\subsection*{Part E: Initial Value Problems}

\begin{enumerate}[resume]
\item From Part A #1: $y = c_1t + c_2t^2$\\
$y(1) = c_1 + c_2 = 3$\\
$y'(t) = c_1 + 2c_2t$\\
$y'(1) = c_1 + 2c_2 = 5$\\
Solving: $c_2 = 2$, $c_1 = 1$\\
Solution: $y = t + 2t^2$

\item From Part A #2: $y = \frac{c_1 + c_2\ln t}{t}$\\
$y(1) = c_1 = 2$\\
$y'(t) = \frac{c_2 - c_1 - c_2\ln t}{t^2}$\\
$y'(1) = c_2 - c_1 = -1$\\
$c_2 = 1$\\
Solution: $y = \frac{2 + \ln t}{t}$

\item From Part B #8: $y = (c_1 + c_2\ln t)t$\\
$y(1) = c_1 = 0$\\
$y'(t) = c_1 + c_2(1 + \ln t)$\\
$y'(1) = c_2 = 1$\\
Solution: $y = t\ln t$

\item From Part C #11: $y = t[c_1\cos(2\ln t) + c_2\sin(2\ln t)]$\\
$y(1) = c_1 = 1$\\
$y'(t) = [c_1\cos(2\ln t) + c_2\sin(2\ln t)] + t[-2c_1\sin(2\ln t)/t + 2c_2\cos(2\ln t)/t]$\\
$y'(1) = 1 + 2c_2 = 2$\\
$c_2 = \frac{1}{2}$\\
Solution: $y = t[\cos(2\ln t) + \frac{1}{2}\sin(2\ln t)]$

\item From Part A #5: $y = (c_1 + c_2\ln t)t^2$\\
$y(2) = 4c_1 + 4c_2\ln 2 = 8$\\
$y'(t) = 2(c_1 + c_2\ln t)t + c_2t$\\
$y'(2) = 8c_1 + 8c_2\ln 2 + 2c_2 = 12$\\
From first: $c_1 + c_2\ln 2 = 2$\\
From second: $4c_1 + 4c_2\ln 2 + c_2 = 6$\\
$c_2 = -2$, $c_1 = 2 + 2\ln 2$\\
Solution: $y = [2 + 2\ln 2 - 2\ln t]t^2 = 2t^2[1 + \ln(4/t)]$
\end{enumerate}

\subsection*{Part F: Exam-Style Problems}

\begin{enumerate}[resume]
\item
\begin{enumerate}[label=(\alph*)]
\item Bounded as $t \to \infty$: Need both roots to have negative real parts.\\
From $r^2 + (a-1)r + b = 0$: Need $a > 1$ and $b > 0$ (and $(a-1)^2 > 4b$ for real roots).

\item Oscillation: Need complex roots, so $(a-1)^2 < 4b$.

\item Polynomial solutions: Need positive integer roots. For example, $r = n$ requires $n^2 + (a-1)n + b = 0$.
\end{enumerate}

\item
\begin{enumerate}[label=(\alph*)]
\item $y_1' = \alpha t^{\alpha-1}$, $y_1'' = \alpha(\alpha-1)t^{\alpha-2}$\\
Substitute: $\alpha(\alpha-1) - 2\alpha \cdot \alpha + \alpha(\alpha+1) = 0$ ✓

\item Characteristic equation: $r^2 - (2\alpha+1)r + \alpha(\alpha+1) = 0$\\
$(r-\alpha)(r-(\alpha+1)) = 0$\\
Second solution: $y_2 = t^{\alpha+1}$

\item This is the Euler equation whose solutions are consecutive powers of $t$.
\end{enumerate}

\item Let $s = t + 1$, then the equation becomes:\\
$s^2y'' + 3sy' + y = 0$ (standard Euler in $s$)\\
Characteristic: $r^2 + 2r + 1 = (r+1)^2 = 0$\\
$y = \frac{c_1 + c_2\ln(t+1)}{t+1}$

\item
\begin{enumerate}[label=(\alph*)]
\item The $t^2$ in the last term makes this NOT a pure Euler equation.

\item For the indicial equation, consider $y = t^r(1 + a_1t + \ldots)$\\
Leading terms give: $r(r-1) + r - \nu^2 = 0$\\
$r^2 - \nu^2 = 0$

\item Indices: $r = \pm\nu$
\end{enumerate}

\item
\begin{enumerate}[label=(\alph*)]
\item Decouple: Fourth-order equations result.\\
For $y$: $(t^2D^2 - 2tD + 2)(t^2D^2 - 4tD + 6) - 1 = 0$\\
This gives $t^4y^{(4)} - 6t^3y''' + 15t^2y'' - 15ty' + (12-1)y = 0$\\
Complex calculation yields general solutions.

\item As $t \to 0^+$: Solutions behave like $t^r$ where $r$ are the characteristic roots. Bounded only if all $\text{Re}(r) \geq 0$.
\end{enumerate}
\end{enumerate}

```
1. Let x = ln(t)
2. Transform to v'' + (a-1)v' + bv = 0
3. Solve as constant coefficient
4. Transform back: t^r = e^(rx)
```

## **The Characteristic Equation**

### MEMORIZE:
For $t²y'' + aty' + by = 0$:
```
Characteristic: r² + (a-1)r + b = 0
```

Note: It's (a-1), not just a!

## **Solution Forms Quick Reference**

| Root Type | Solution Form |
|-----------|--------------|
| Distinct real r₁, r₂ | c₁t^(r₁) + c₂t^(r₂) |
| Repeated real r | (c₁ + c₂ln(t))t^r |
| Complex α ± iβ | t^α[c₁cos(βln(t)) + c₂sin(βln(t))] |

## **Key Differences from Constant Coefficients**

| Feature | Constant Coeff | Euler Equation |
|---------|---------------|----------------|
| Ansatz | e^(rt) | t^r |
| Repeated adds | t | ln(t) |
| Complex args | βt | βln(t) |
| Domain | All ℝ | Usually t > 0 |
| Singular point | None | t = 0 |

## **Practice Problem Strategy**

### Part A (Basic):
- Straightforward characteristic equations
- Practice the formula r² + (a-1)r + b = 0
- All have distinct real roots

### Part B (Repeated):
- Watch for perfect squares in characteristic
- Remember: (c₁ + c₂ln(t))t^r
- The ln(t) is crucial!

### Part C (Complex):
- Negative discriminant → complex roots
- Arguments are βln(t), not βt
- Factor out t^α

### Part D (Transform):
- Good for verifying answers
- Shows the deep connection
- Useful for higher-order equations

### Part E (IVPs):
- Usually at t = 1 (avoids singularity)
- Same process as constant coefficients
- Check: Does solution blow up at t = 0?

### Part F (Theory):
- Behavior as t → 0⁺ and t → ∞
- Connection to other equation types
- Prof. Ditkowski's favorites

## **Common Mistakes to Avoid**

1. **Wrong characteristic equation**
   - WRONG: r² + ar + b = 0
   - RIGHT: r² + (a-1)r + b = 0

2. **Forgetting ln(t) for repeated roots**
   - WRONG: c₁t² + c₂t² (not independent!)
   - RIGHT: (c₁ + c₂ln(t))t²

3. **Wrong argument for complex roots**
   - WRONG: t²[cos(3t) + sin(3t)]
   - RIGHT: t²[cos(3ln(t)) + sin(3ln(t))]

4. **Domain issues**
   - Solutions for t > 0 and t < 0 are different
   - Can't always extend through t = 0

## **Speed Techniques**

### Quick Recognition:
- See t²y'' + aty' + by? → Euler equation
- Powers match derivatives? → Euler equation
- Coefficients are t^n? → Euler equation

### Fast Solution:
1. Write characteristic immediately
2. Use quadratic formula
3. Identify root type
4. Write solution form

### Verification:
- Substitute one value (like t = 1) to check
- Behavior at t = 0 should match root signs
- Use transform method to double-check

## **Memory Aids**

### "Power to Power":
- Power ansatz (t^r) for power coefficients (t^n)
- Like responds to like

### The (a-1) Rule:
- The y' coefficient contributes (a-1), not a
- Think: "One less for the first derivative"

### Complex Oscillation:
- Regular ODEs: oscillate in time
- Euler equations: oscillate in log-time
- cos(βln(t)) = t^(iβ) in complex form

## **Connections to Other Topics**

### Series Solutions:
- t = 0 is a regular singular point
- Characteristic equation = indicial equation
- Frobenius method starts here

### Bessel Functions:
