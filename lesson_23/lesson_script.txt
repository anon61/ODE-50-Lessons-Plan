Episode 23: Integrating Factors - μ(x) and μ(y) Cases**

Audio Lesson Script**

*[Opening with enthusiasm]*

So you've tested an equation for exactness and... it failed! The partial derivatives don't match. Game over? Not at all! Here's the key insight that'll blow your mind: we can often multiply the entire equation by a special function called an integrating factor, and boom - it becomes exact! It's like having a magic wand that transforms unsolvable equations into ones we already know how to handle.

Let me show you the big picture first. When we have a non-exact equation Mdx + Ndy = 0, we're looking for a function μ (that's the Greek letter mu) such that when we multiply everything by μ, the new equation μMdx + μNdy = 0 IS exact. The beauty is that the solutions don't change - we're just repackaging the same equation in a friendlier form.

Now here's where it gets interesting. In theory, integrating factors always exist, but finding them can be incredibly hard. The good news? For Prof. Ditkowski's exam, we focus on two special cases that cover 90% of problems: when μ depends only on x, written as μ(x), or only on y, written as μ(y).

So basically, how do we know if μ(x) exists? Here's the magical formula - and yes, you need to memorize this! Calculate (∂M/∂y - ∂N/∂x)/N. If this expression depends ONLY on x - no y's anywhere - then μ(x) exists, and we find it by solving dμ/dx = μ · [(My - Nx)/N].

Let me walk you through an example. Consider (3xy + y²)dx + (x² + xy)dy = 0. First, check exactness: ∂M/∂y = 3x + 2y and ∂N/∂x = 2x + y. Not equal - not exact! Now let's check for μ(x): (My - Nx)/N = (3x + 2y - 2x - y)/(x² + xy) = (x + y)/(x² + xy) = (x + y)/(x(x + y)) = 1/x.

Beautiful! This depends only on x. So we have dμ/dx = μ/x, which gives μ = x (choosing the constant of integration as 1 for simplicity). Multiply the original equation by x: (3x²y + xy²)dx + (x³ + x²y)dy = 0. Now check: ∂M/∂y = 3x² + 2xy and ∂N/∂x = 3x² + 2xy. They match! It's exact!

What about μ(y)? The test is similar but flipped: calculate (∂N/∂x - ∂M/∂y)/M. If this depends only on y, then μ(y) exists. Notice the numerator is the negative of what we had before, and now we divide by M instead of N.

Here's a classic example Prof. Ditkowski loves: (2y)dx + (3x)dy = 0. Check exactness: ∂M/∂y = 2, ∂N/∂x = 3. Not exact! For μ(x): (2-3)/3x = -1/3x, depends on x. For μ(y): (3-2)/2y = 1/2y, depends on y. Both exist!

Let's use μ(y) = y^(1/2). Multiplying: (2y^(3/2))dx + (3xy^(1/2))dy = 0. Check: ∂M/∂y = 3y^(1/2), ∂N/∂x = 3y^(1/2). Exact! The potential function is H = 2xy^(3/2), so solutions are xy^(3/2) = C.

Common mistake alert! Students often forget that after finding μ and multiplying, you still need to solve the resulting exact equation. Finding the integrating factor is only half the battle - you then use the methods from Lesson 22 to find the potential function!

Here's a memory trick I love: "My Nexus over N" gives μ(x), while "Nexus My over M" gives μ(y). The one with x in the denominator gives μ(x), the one with y sound (My) in the denominator gives μ(y).

Now, what if neither test works? What if (My - Nx)/N has both x and y, and so does (Nx - My)/M? Then neither μ(x) nor μ(y) exists, and we need fancier integrating factors - that's next lesson's adventure with μ(xy) and other special forms.

Prof. Ditkowski's exam tip: He often gives hints like "Find an integrating factor depending only on x" or "Show that μ = x² is an integrating factor." When you see these hints, you skip the existence test and jump straight to verification or using the given factor.

Remember linear equations from Block 5? The integrating factor μ = e^(∫P(x)dx) for y' + P(x)y = Q(x)? That's a special case of this general theory! Linear equations always have μ(x) because they can be written as (Py - Q)dx + dy = 0, and our test gives (P - 0)/1 = P(x), which depends only on x.

The physical interpretation is cool too. Sometimes the original equation represents a non-conservative force field, but there's a hidden weighting function (the integrating factor) that reveals an underlying conservation law. It's like finding the right perspective that shows the hidden structure!

So basically, integrating factors are your rescue plan when exactness fails. Check for μ(x) first (usually simpler), then μ(y) if needed. Once you find μ, multiply through, verify exactness, and solve using the methods from Lesson 22. Master this, and you'll handle 90% of non-exact equations on the exam!
