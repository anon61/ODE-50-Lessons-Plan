# **Lesson 14: Linear First-Order ODEs - The Standard Method**

## **Part 1: Audio Lesson Script**

Hey there! Welcome to Lesson 14, where we're diving into linear first-order ODEs - honestly, this is THE most important type of first-order equation you'll encounter. If you master this one method, you'll be able to solve about 40% of the problems on Prof. Ditkowski's exam. So let's really dig in here.

Let me start with a real problem you might see. Imagine you have a tank with salty water, and fresh water is flowing in while the mixed water flows out. The salt concentration changes over time according to the equation dy/dt + (2/t)y = 5. This is a linear first-order ODE, and by the end of this lesson, solving it will feel completely natural.

So basically, a linear first-order ODE has this standard form: y' + p(t)y = g(t). Here's the key insight - the y and y' terms appear linearly, meaning no y², no sin(y), no e^y - just plain y and y' with coefficients that might depend on t. The function p(t) is what we call the coefficient function, and g(t) is the forcing function or non-homogeneous term.

Now, when g(t) = 0, we get y' + p(t)y = 0, which is called the homogeneous equation. This one's actually pretty easy to solve - just separate variables! We get dy/y = -p(t)dt, which integrates to ln|y| = -∫p(t)dt + C, giving us y = Ae^(-∫p(t)dt). Remember this formula - it's the homogeneous solution and it'll be crucial for everything we do next.

But here's where things get interesting. When g(t) ≠ 0, separation of variables doesn't work anymore. So mathematicians developed this brilliant trick called the integrating factor method. The idea is to multiply the entire equation by a special function μ(t) that magically makes the left side become the derivative of a product.

Let me show you the magic. We want to find μ(t) such that when we multiply our equation by it, we get μ(t)y' + μ(t)p(t)y = μ(t)g(t), and somehow the left side becomes d/dt[μ(t)y]. For this to work, we need μ(t)y' + μ(t)p(t)y = μ(t)y' + μ'(t)y. Comparing these, we see that μ'(t) = μ(t)p(t), which means μ'(t)/μ(t) = p(t).

Integrating both sides, we get ln|μ(t)| = ∫p(t)dt, so μ(t) = e^(∫p(t)dt). Notice I dropped the absolute value and the constant - we only need one integrating factor, not a family of them, so we pick the simplest one.

Here's the complete algorithm, and this is exactly how you should write it on the exam:

Step 1: Write the equation in standard form y' + p(t)y = g(t). Watch out - sometimes you need to divide by the coefficient of y' first!

Step 2: Compute the integrating factor μ(t) = e^(∫p(t)dt). Don't add a constant of integration here.

Step 3: Multiply the entire equation by μ(t).

Step 4: Recognize that the left side is now d/dt[μ(t)y].

Step 5: Integrate both sides: μ(t)y = ∫μ(t)g(t)dt + C.

Step 6: Solve for y by dividing by μ(t).

Let's work through our mixing problem: y' + (2/t)y = 5. First, we identify p(t) = 2/t, so μ(t) = e^(∫2/t dt) = e^(2ln|t|) = t². Multiplying by t²: t²y' + 2ty = 5t². The left side is d/dt[t²y], so integrating: t²y = (5t³)/3 + C. Therefore, y = 5t/3 + C/t².

Now here's a common mistake - students often mess up the integration when finding μ(t). Remember, ∫1/t dt = ln|t|, not just ln(t). But when we exponentiate, e^(ln|t|) = |t|, and we usually just write t if we're working where t > 0.

Let me give you another example with a trickier p(t). Consider y' - (tan t)y = sec t. Here p(t) = -tan t, so μ(t) = e^(-∫tan t dt) = e^(ln|cos t|) = cos t (assuming cos t > 0). Multiplying through: (cos t)y' - (sin t)y = 1. This is d/dt[(cos t)y] = 1, so (cos t)y = t + C, giving y = (t + C)/cos t = (t + C)sec t.

A crucial exam tip: Prof. Ditkowski loves to give you initial conditions. If y(t₀) = y₀, solve for C using this condition AFTER you get the general solution. Don't try to incorporate it earlier - that's a recipe for errors.

Also, watch for discontinuities! If p(t) or g(t) has a discontinuity at some point, your solution might only be valid on intervals where both are continuous. For instance, if p(t) = 1/t, your solution will have different forms for t > 0 and t < 0, and you can't generally connect them at t = 0.

One more insight - the general solution always has the form y = y_h + y_p, where y_h is the homogeneous solution (with the arbitrary constant) and y_p is a particular solution. This is the superposition principle, and it's fundamental to all linear ODEs.

To remember the integrating factor formula, think "e to the integral of p" - it rhymes! And always, always verify your solution by substituting back into the original equation. Prof. Ditkowski gives partial credit for verification even if your solution is wrong.

\title{Linear First-Order ODEs: The Standard Method}
\author{ODE 1 - Prof. Adi Ditkowski}

\begin{document}
\maketitle

\section{Introduction and Motivation}

Linear first-order ODEs form the backbone of differential equations theory. They appear in countless applications: population dynamics, RC circuits, mixing problems, radioactive decay, and Newton's law of cooling.

\begin{definition}[Linear First-Order ODE]
A \textbf{linear first-order ODE} has the form:
\begin{equation}
a_1(t)\frac{dy}{dt} + a_0(t)y = g(t)
\end{equation}
where $a_1(t) \neq 0$ on the interval of interest. The \textbf{standard form} is:
\begin{equation}
\frac{dy}{dt} + p(t)y = g(t)
\end{equation}
where $p(t) = a_0(t)/a_1(t)$ and the right-hand side has been divided by $a_1(t)$.
\end{definition}

\begin{keypoint}
The equation is called \textbf{linear} because $y$ and $y'$ appear to the first power only, with no products like $yy'$ or nonlinear terms like $y^2$, $\sin(y)$, etc.
\end{keypoint}

\section{Classification}

\begin{definition}[Homogeneous vs Non-homogeneous]
\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Homogeneous}: $y' + p(t)y = 0$ (when $g(t) \equiv 0$)
\item \textbf{Non-homogeneous}: $y' + p(t)y = g(t)$ (when $g(t) \not\equiv 0$)
\end{itemize}
\end{definition}

\section{Solution of Homogeneous Equation}

For $y' + p(t)y = 0$, we can use separation of variables:

\begin{align}
\frac{dy}{dt} &= -p(t)y \\
\frac{dy}{y} &= -p(t)dt \\
\ln|y| &= -\int p(t)dt + C_1 \\
y &= Ce^{-\int p(t)dt}
\end{align}

where $C = \pm e^{C_1}$ (or $C = 0$ if $y \equiv 0$).

\begin{formula}
\textbf{Homogeneous Solution:} $y_h = Ce^{-\int p(t)dt}$
\end{formula}

\section{The Integrating Factor Method}

\begin{theorem}[Integrating Factor Method]
For the equation $y' + p(t)y = g(t)$, the integrating factor
\[\mu(t) = e^{\int p(t)dt}\]
transforms the equation into an exact derivative:
\[\frac{d}{dt}[\mu(t)y] = \mu(t)g(t)\]
\end{theorem}

\begin{proof}
Starting with $y' + p(t)y = g(t)$, multiply both sides by $\mu(t)$:
\[\mu(t)y' + \mu(t)p(t)y = \mu(t)g(t)\]

We want the left side to equal $\frac{d}{dt}[\mu(t)y]$. Computing this derivative:
\[\frac{d}{dt}[\mu(t)y] = \mu'(t)y + \mu(t)y'\]

For these to be equal:
\[\mu'(t)y + \mu(t)y' = \mu(t)y' + \mu(t)p(t)y\]

This requires $\mu'(t) = \mu(t)p(t)$, or $\frac{\mu'(t)}{\mu(t)} = p(t)$.

Integrating: $\ln|\mu(t)| = \int p(t)dt$, giving $\mu(t) = e^{\int p(t)dt}$.
\end{proof}

\section{Complete Solution Algorithm}

\begin{method}[Solving Linear First-Order ODEs]
\begin{enumerate}
\item Convert to standard form: $y' + p(t)y = g(t)$
\item Compute integrating factor: $\mu(t) = e^{\int p(t)dt}$
\item Multiply equation by $\mu(t)$: $\mu(t)y' + \mu(t)p(t)y = \mu(t)g(t)$
\item Recognize: $\frac{d}{dt}[\mu(t)y] = \mu(t)g(t)$
\item Integrate: $\mu(t)y = \int \mu(t)g(t)dt + C$
\item Solve for $y$: $y = \frac{1}{\mu(t)}\left[\int \mu(t)g(t)dt + C\right]$
\end{enumerate}
\end{method}

\begin{warning}
Common errors:
\begin{itemize}
\item Adding a constant when computing $\mu(t)$ (don't!)
\item Forgetting absolute values in logarithms
\item Not checking continuity of $p(t)$ and $g(t)$
\item Missing the arbitrary constant in the final integration
\end{itemize}
\end{warning}

\section{Examples}

\begin{example}[Constant Coefficients]
Solve $y' + 2y = e^{3t}$ with $y(0) = 1$.

\textbf{Solution:}
\begin{itemize}
\item $p(t) = 2$, so $\mu(t) = e^{2t}$
\item Multiplying: $e^{2t}y' + 2e^{2t}y = e^{5t}$
\item This is $\frac{d}{dt}[e^{2t}y] = e^{5t}$
\item Integrating: $e^{2t}y = \frac{1}{5}e^{5t} + C$
\item Therefore: $y = \frac{1}{5}e^{3t} + Ce^{-2t}$
\item Using $y(0) = 1$: $1 = \frac{1}{5} + C$, so $C = \frac{4}{5}$
\item Final answer: $y = \frac{1}{5}e^{3t} + \frac{4}{5}e^{-2t}$
\end{itemize}
\end{example}

\begin{example}[Variable Coefficients]
Solve $ty' + 2y = t^2$ for $t > 0$.

\textbf{Solution:}
\begin{itemize}
\item Standard form: $y' + \frac{2}{t}y = t$
\item $p(t) = \frac{2}{t}$, so $\mu(t) = e^{2\ln t} = t^2$
\item Multiplying: $t^2y' + 2ty = t^3$
\item This is $\frac{d}{dt}[t^2y] = t^3$
\item Integrating: $t^2y = \frac{t^4}{4} + C$
\item Therefore: $y = \frac{t^2}{4} + \frac{C}{t^2}$
\end{itemize}
\end{example}

\section{Solution Structure}

\begin{theorem}[Superposition Principle]
The general solution of $y' + p(t)y = g(t)$ can be written as:
\[y = y_h + y_p\]
where $y_h$ is the general solution of the homogeneous equation and $y_p$ is any particular solution of the non-homogeneous equation.
\end{theorem}

\begin{insight}
This structure appears in ALL linear ODEs, regardless of order. Understanding it here prepares you for second-order and higher-order linear equations.
\end{insight}

\section{Existence and Uniqueness}

\begin{theorem}[Existence and Uniqueness for Linear First-Order]
If $p(t)$ and $g(t)$ are continuous on an interval $I$ containing $t_0$, then for any initial condition $y(t_0) = y_0$, there exists a unique solution defined on all of $I$.
\end{theorem}

\begin{examtip}
Prof. Ditkowski often asks about solution intervals. Remember:
\begin{itemize}
\item Solutions exist wherever $p(t)$ and $g(t)$ are continuous
\item Discontinuities create natural boundaries for solution domains
\item Always state the interval of validity for your solution
\end{itemize}
\end{examtip}

\section{Connection to Exact Equations}

\begin{keypoint}
After multiplying by $\mu(t)$, the equation becomes:
\[\mu(t)y' + \mu(t)p(t)y = \mu(t)g(t)\]
This is exact with $M = \mu(t)p(t)y - \mu(t)g(t)$ and $N = \mu(t)$.
\end{keypoint}

\section{Physical Applications}

\subsection{RC Circuit}
For a resistor-capacitor circuit with voltage source $V(t)$:
\[\frac{dQ}{dt} + \frac{1}{RC}Q = \frac{V(t)}{R}\]

\subsection{Mixing Problem}
For a tank with volume $V$, inflow rate $r_{in}$, outflow rate $r_{out}$, and input concentration $c_{in}(t)$:
\[\frac{dy}{dt} + \frac{r_{out}}{V}y = \frac{r_{in}}{V}c_{in}(t)\]

\subsection{Newton's Law of Cooling}
For temperature $T(t)$ in ambient temperature $T_a$:
\[\frac{dT}{dt} + kT = kT_a\]

**Lesson 14 complete.** You now have the complete foundation for linear first-order ODEs. Master this material thoroughly before moving on, as it forms the basis for everything that follows. Request 'Generate Lesson 15' for the next lesson in Block 5, where we'll dive deeper into the mathematical theory behind integrating factors.
**Excellent work getting through Lesson 14! You've just covered one of the most fundamental techniques in differential equations - the integrating factor method. This is genuinely one of those "aha!" moments in mathematics where a seemingly difficult problem becomes mechanical once you understand the trick.

Before we move forward to Lesson 15, I want to make sure you're getting the most out of Lesson 14. The linear first-order ODE with its integrating factor method is something you'll use constantly - not just for first-order equations, but as a building block for understanding higher-order linear equations and systems. Think of it like learning multiplication tables before tackling long division - this foundational skill needs to be rock solid.

Here's what I recommend you do with Lesson 14 before we continue:

First, really internalize that integrating factor formula μ(t) = e^(∫p(t)dt). Write it out several times, and more importantly, understand WHY it works. The magic is that it transforms our equation into something we can integrate directly - it's converting a problem we can't solve into one we can. That's a recurring theme in mathematics that you'll see again and again.

Second, practice recognizing when an equation needs to be converted to standard form. This catches so many students on exams! If you see something like 3ty' - 6y = t²e^t, your first instinct should be "divide by 3t to get standard form." This needs to become automatic.

Third, work through at least the first three sections of practice problems (Parts A, B, and C). Don't skip the verification step - substituting your solution back into the original equation. Professor Ditkowski values this verification process, and it's actually a great way to catch algebraic errors.

## When You're Ready for Lesson 15

Once you feel comfortable with the material in Lesson 14 - and I mean truly comfortable, where you could explain the integrating factor method to a friend - then you're ready for the next step.

Lesson 15 will take you deeper into the mathematics behind integrating factors. We'll explore why this particular choice of μ(t) creates an exact equation, look at alternative forms of integrating factors, and connect this technique to the broader theory of differential equations. It's where we move from "how to solve" to "why it works" at a much deeper level.

To proceed with Lesson 15, simply type **"Generate Lesson 15"** and I'll provide you with the complete next lesson, including:
- A detailed audio script that dives deep into the theory
- A comprehensive LaTeX document with proofs and advanced insights
- A new set of practice problems that will challenge your understanding
- Specific study strategies for mastering the deeper theory

Take your time with Lesson 14 - there's no rush. The beauty of mathematics is that when you truly understand each piece, the whole picture becomes much clearer. Remember, this material typically represents 30-40% of exam problems, so mastering it thoroughly will pay huge dividends on your exam.

Are you ready to request Lesson 15, or would you like me to clarify anything about Lesson 14 first? I'm here to make sure you truly master this material for Professor Ditkowski's course.
