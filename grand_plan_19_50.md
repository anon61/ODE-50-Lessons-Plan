## Processing Strategy

### Phase 1: Extraction (All Lessons)
```bash
for i in {19..50}; do
    # Read Lessons 19 and more/XX.txt
    # Extract three components:
    # - Audio script (Part 1 or Component 1)
    # - Theory LaTeX (Part 2 or Component 2)
    # - Problems LaTeX (Part 3 or Component 3)
done
```

### Phase 2: File Creation (Per Lesson)
1. Create directory `lesson_XX/`
2. Save audio script as `lesson_script.txt`
3. Save theory as `lesson_XX.tex`
4. Save problems as `problems_XX.tex`

### Phase 3: LaTeX Processing
1. Fix Unicode issues:
   - Replace special characters (Ω → \Omega, etc.)
   - Ensure proper LaTeX formatting
2. Add missing packages if needed
3. Compile to PDFs

### Phase 4: Quality Check
- Verify 28 problems per lesson
- Check LaTeX compilation
- Ensure consistency with Prof. Ditkowski style

## File Structure (Per Lesson)
```
lesson_XX/
├── lesson_script.txt      # Audio-friendly conversational script
├── lesson_XX.tex          # Theory document
├── lesson_XX.pdf          # Compiled theory PDF
├── lesson_XX.aux          # LaTeX auxiliary file
├── problems_XX.tex        # Practice problems
├── problems_XX.pdf        # Compiled problems PDF
└── problems_XX.aux        # LaTeX auxiliary file
```

## Common Patterns Observed

### Audio Scripts
- Conversational tone with "So basically..."
- Prof. Ditkowski exam tips
- Physical interpretations
- Common mistakes to avoid
- Memory devices and tricks

### Theory Documents
- Formal definitions and theorems
- Step-by-step methods
- Multiple examples with increasing complexity
- Keypoint/Warning/Insight boxes
- Connection to other lessons

### Problem Sets Structure
- Part A: Basic Concepts (6 problems)
- Part B: Core Techniques (6 problems)
- Part C: Applications (5 problems)
- Part D: Advanced/Theoretical (5 problems)
- Part E: Exam-Style Questions (6 problems)
- Answer key with hints

## Automation Script Template
```python
# For each lesson 19-50:
1. Read source file from "Lessons 19 and more/XX.txt"
2. Split into three sections based on markers
3. Clean and format each section
4. Create lesson directory
5. Write three files
6. Compile LaTeX files
7. Verify outputs
8. Commit to Git
```

## Timeline Estimate
- **Extraction & Formatting**: 2-3 minutes per lesson
- **LaTeX Compilation**: 1-2 minutes per lesson
- **Total for 32 lessons**: ~2-3 hours of processing

## Special Considerations

### Complex Topics (Lessons 29-39)
- Systems require matrix notation
- May need TikZ for phase portraits
- Extra care with eigenvalue computations

### Series Solutions (Lessons 45-48)
- Heavy mathematical notation
- Special functions require careful formatting
- May need additional LaTeX packages

### Numerical Methods (Lesson 50)
- Includes algorithm descriptions
- May benefit from pseudocode environments
- Tables for comparing methods

## Success Metrics
- [ ] All 32 lessons extracted and formatted
- [ ] 96 files created (3 per lesson)
- [ ] 64 PDFs generated (2 per lesson)
- [ ] All lessons follow consistent structure
- [ ] Git repository updated with complete course

## Next Steps
1. Execute extraction for lessons 19-50
2. Process in batches of 5-6 lessons
3. Commit after each batch
4. Final review and push to GitHub
5. Create index/table of contents for complete course
