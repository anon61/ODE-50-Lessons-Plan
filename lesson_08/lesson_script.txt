Episode 8: Parameter-Dependent Existence Problems
"Now let's tackle parameter-dependent problems - these are huge on exams! So basically, when your ODE contains parameters, the existence and uniqueness can depend on those parameter values. Here's the key insight: parameters can make or break the Lipschitz condition, create or destroy singularities, and fundamentally change the solution behavior.
Consider the parametric IVP:
y' = f(x, y; μ) with y(x₀) = y₀(μ)
The big questions:

For which μ does a solution exist?
For which μ is it unique?
How does the solution depend on μ?

Let me show you a systematic approach:
Example 1: Linear parameter dependence
y' = μy with y(0) = 1
For ALL μ, we have existence and uniqueness (linear equations are always nice!)
Solution: y = e^(μx)
But notice: behavior changes dramatically with μ!

μ < 0: exponential decay
μ = 0: constant solution
μ > 0: exponential growth

Example 2: Parameter in the denominator
y' = y/(x - μ) with y(0) = 1
Existence and uniqueness everywhere EXCEPT x = μ!

If μ < 0: solution exists for all x ≥ 0
If μ = 0: no solution through (0,1)
If μ > 0: solution exists until x = μ, then blows up

This is a removable singularity that moves with the parameter!
Example 3: Parameter affects Lipschitz
y' = μ|y|^(1/2) with y(0) = 0
Lipschitz analysis:

μ = 0: y' = 0, unique solution y = 0
μ ≠ 0: Not Lipschitz at y = 0, infinitely many solutions!

The parameter acts like an on/off switch for uniqueness!
Here's the general strategy for parameter problems:
Step 1: Identify parameter locations

In coefficients? Usually safe
In denominators? Watch for zeros
In exponents? Check Lipschitz
In domain restrictions? Check boundaries

Step 2: Find critical parameter values
These are values where:

Denominators vanish
Lipschitz constant becomes infinite
Domain of definition changes
Equilibria appear or disappear

Step 3: Analyze each parameter regime separately
Let me demonstrate with a comprehensive example:
The Parametric Riccati Equation:
y' = y² - μ with y(0) = y₀
Analysis by parameter:
Case μ < 0:

No real equilibria
All solutions blow up in finite time
Unique solution exists until blow-up

Case μ = 0:

y' = y²
Solutions: y = 1/(c - x) blow up at x = c
If y₀ = 0: unique solution y = 0
If y₀ ≠ 0: solution blows up at x = 1/y₀

Case μ > 0:

Two equilibria: y = ±√μ
Solutions exist globally if |y₀| < √μ
Solutions blow up if |y₀| > √μ
Critical case |y₀| = √μ: solution approaches equilibrium

Continuous Dependence on Parameters:
Theorem: If f and ∂f/∂y are continuous in (x, y, μ), then the solution y(x, μ) is continuous in μ.
But beware! Continuous doesn't mean smooth. Small parameter changes can cause:

Bifurcations (solution structure changes)
Blow-up time shifts
Stability switches

Classic exam example - the pitchfork bifurcation:
y' = μy - y³ with y(0) = y₀
Equilibria:

μ ≤ 0: Only y = 0
μ > 0: Three equilibria y = 0, ±√μ

The solution structure completely changes at μ = 0!
Parameter identification problems:
'Find all μ such that the solution exists globally.'
Example: y' = y² + μy + 1 with y(0) = 0
This is Riccati. When does it not blow up?
Analyze discriminant of y² + μy + 1:

Δ = μ² - 4
Need Δ ≥ 0 for real roots (equilibria)
So |μ| ≥ 2 for bounded solutions
For |μ| < 2, all solutions blow up!

Asymptotic behavior depending on parameters:
Consider: y' = y(μ - y) with y(0) = y₀ > 0
Long-term behavior:

μ ≤ 0: y → 0 (extinction)
μ > 0: y → μ (convergence to carrying capacity)

The parameter μ determines the entire fate of the solution!
Here's an exam goldmine - singular perturbations:
εy' = -y + μ with y(0) = 1, where ε is small
For ε > 0: Solution exists uniquely
As ε → 0: Rapid transition to y ≈ μ
This models fast transients in physics!
Common exam traps with parameters:

'For which α does y' = |y|^α have unique solutions?'
Answer: α ≥ 1 (Lipschitz requirement)
'Find μ such that all solutions are periodic.'
Often requires μ to make the system conservative
'When does the solution exist for all time?'
Check for blow-up conditions depending on μ

Memory device: 'PARAMETER checks: Position (where is μ?), Anomalies (singularities), Regimes (different cases), Analysis (each case separately), Monotonicity (how solution changes with μ), Equilibria, Transitions, Existence, Rate of growth.'
Pro tip for exams: Always sketch a bifurcation diagram! Draw μ on horizontal axis, equilibria on vertical. Show stable (solid) and unstable (dashed) branches. Prof. Ditkowski loves these because they show you understand the global parameter dependence.
Final warning: When μ appears in initial conditions y(0) = g(μ), check if this creates additional constraints. Sometimes certain parameter values make the initial condition undefined or place it at a non-Lipschitz point!"
