Episode 41: Hartman-Grobman Theorem - When Linearization Works**

Audio Lesson Script**

Welcome to Lesson 41! Today we're tackling one of the most important theorems in dynamical systems - the Hartman-Grobman theorem. This is the theorem that tells us WHEN we can trust linearization, and when we need to be careful. Prof. Ditkowski loves this because it connects mathematical rigor with practical application.

So basically, here's the big question from last lesson: we learned how to linearize nonlinear systems near critical points. But when does this linearization actually tell us the truth about the nonlinear system? That's exactly what Hartman-Grobman answers!

Let me give you the intuition first. Imagine you're looking at a photograph of a mountain landscape. If you zoom in on a rocky cliff face, the photo accurately shows you it's steep and jagged. But if you zoom in on the very peak - that transition point where one side goes up and the other goes down - the photo might not capture the full 3D nature of that saddle point. The Hartman-Grobman theorem tells us when our "linearization photo" is trustworthy.

Here's the key concept: a critical point is called HYPERBOLIC if all eigenvalues of the Jacobian have non-zero real parts. In other words, no eigenvalues lie on the imaginary axis. When a critical point is hyperbolic, Hartman-Grobman guarantees that the linearization tells us the complete local story!

The formal statement is beautiful: If $(x_0, y_0)$ is a hyperbolic equilibrium, then near this point, the nonlinear system and its linearization are "topologically conjugate." This fancy term means there's a continuous deformation that transforms trajectories of one system into trajectories of the other, preserving their essential behavior.

Let me show you what this means practically. Consider the system:
ẋ = x + y²
ẏ = -2y + x²

The only critical point is (0,0). The Jacobian at the origin is:
J = [1  0]
    [0 -2]

Eigenvalues are λ₁ = 1 and λ₂ = -2. Since both have non-zero real parts, this is hyperbolic! Hartman-Grobman tells us the origin is definitely a saddle point for the nonlinear system, just like its linearization predicts. The stable manifold comes in along the y-axis direction (corresponding to λ = -2), and the unstable manifold goes out along the x-axis direction (corresponding to λ = 1).

Now here's the crucial insight - what about those pesky nonlinear terms y² and x²? Hartman-Grobman says they might bend or curve the trajectories, but they CAN'T change the fundamental saddle structure. That's incredibly powerful!

But watch out - here's where students lose points with Prof. Ditkowski. The theorem does NOT apply when eigenvalues have zero real parts. Let me show you why this matters:

Consider: ẋ = y, ẏ = -x + x³

At the origin, J = [0  1], giving eigenvalues λ = ±i.
                [-1 0]

The linearization says "center" - closed orbits around the origin. But look what that x³ term does! Using energy methods (which we'll see in Lesson 42), you can show the origin is actually UNSTABLE for the nonlinear system. The cubic term completely changes the behavior! This is why Hartman-Grobman requires hyperbolicity.

Here's my memory trick: "HyGro" - Hyperbolic means Grobman works! If eigenvalues touch the imaginary axis, all bets are off.

Let's work through another example that Prof. Ditkowski loves - the bifurcation preview:
ẋ = μx + y - x³
ẏ = -x + μy

At (0,0), the Jacobian is [μ  1]. The eigenvalues are λ = μ ± i.
                          [-1 μ]

When is this hyperbolic? When Re(λ) ≠ 0, which means μ ≠ 0. So:
- If μ < 0: Stable spiral (Hartman-Grobman applies)
- If μ > 0: Unstable spiral (Hartman-Grobman applies)
- If μ = 0: Pure imaginary eigenvalues (Hartman-Grobman FAILS)

At μ = 0, we'd need more sophisticated techniques to determine behavior. This is called a Hopf bifurcation point!

Now, let me clarify what "topological conjugacy" really means for your exam. It preserves:
1. The direction of trajectories (stable stays stable, unstable stays unstable)
2. The existence of separatrices and manifolds
3. The qualitative behavior (nodes stay nodes, saddles stay saddles, spirals stay spirals)

But it does NOT preserve:
1. The exact shape of trajectories
2. The speed along trajectories
3. Distances or angles

Think of it like this: if linearization says "saddle," the nonlinear system might have curved separatrices instead of straight ones, but it's still fundamentally a saddle!

Here's another key insight for the exam. When Prof. Ditkowski asks "Is linearization valid?" you need to check:
1. Are all eigenvalues non-zero? (Non-degenerate)
2. Do all eigenvalues have non-zero real parts? (Hyperbolic)

If yes to both, write: "By the Hartman-Grobman theorem, linearization determines local behavior."
If no, write: "Hartman-Grobman does not apply; linearization may not determine behavior."

A classic exam question involves multiple equilibria. Consider:
ẋ = sin(x)
ẏ = y - cos(x)

Critical points are at x = nπ, y = cos(nπ) = (-1)ⁿ. For even n, we get (0,1), (2π,1), etc. For odd n, we get (π,-1), (3π,-1), etc.

At (0,1): J = [0   0], one zero eigenvalue - NOT hyperbolic!
             [0   1]

At (π,-1): J = [0    0], both eigenvalues positive - hyperbolic!
              [0    1]

So linearization works at (π,-1) but fails at (0,1). This is the kind of careful analysis Prof. Ditkowski expects!

The practical takeaway? When you linearize and get:
- Real eigenvalues with same sign: Definitively a node
- Real eigenvalues with opposite signs: Definitively a saddle
- Complex with non-zero real part: Definitively a spiral
- Purely imaginary or zero: Need additional analysis!

Remember, Hartman-Grobman is your guarantee that linearization isn't lying to you - but only when the hyperbolicity condition holds!
