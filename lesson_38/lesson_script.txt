Episode 38: Drawing Phase Portraits - Step by Step**

Audio Lesson Script**

Hey everyone, welcome to Lesson 38! This is where we get our hands dirty and actually DRAW phase portraits. Last lesson, we learned to classify them - now we're going to master the art of sketching them accurately. Prof. Ditkowski is super picky about portrait quality on exams, so we need to nail this!

So basically, drawing phase portraits is like following a recipe. Miss a step, and your portrait looks wrong. But follow the steps systematically, and you'll get it right every time. Let me walk you through my foolproof five-step method.

Step 1: Find and classify equilibria. This is absolutely crucial - you MUST find all equilibrium points first. Set ẋ = 0 and ẏ = 0, solve the system. For linear systems, usually just the origin, but always check! Then classify using trace and determinant like we learned last time.

Step 2: Compute eigenvalues and eigenvectors. Yes, even if you already classified it! The eigenvalues confirm your classification, but more importantly, the eigenvectors tell you the special directions in your portrait. These are like the skeleton of your drawing.

Here's the key insight - eigenvectors are invariant directions. If you start on an eigenvector, you stay on it forever! For a saddle, these become the stable and unstable manifolds. For nodes, they're the special straight-line trajectories.

Step 3: Draw eigenvector directions. This is where people mess up. For real eigenvalues, draw the eigenvector lines through the origin. But here's the critical part - add arrows! Negative eigenvalue means arrows point TOWARD the origin along that eigenvector. Positive means arrows point AWAY.

Let me show you with an example. Say we have eigenvalue λ₁ = -2 with eigenvector v₁ = (1, 1)ᵀ and λ₂ = 3 with v₂ = (1, -2)ᵀ. Draw the line y = x for v₁ with arrows pointing inward. Draw the line y = -2x for v₂ with arrows pointing outward. Boom - you've got your saddle's separatrices!

Step 4: Determine flow direction. This is where we figure out which way trajectories curve. Pick a test point in each region created by your eigenvectors. Let's say we pick (1, 0). Compute ẋ and ẏ at that point using your original system. This gives you the direction vector at that point. Draw a small arrow. This tells you how trajectories behave in that entire region!

Step 5: Add trajectories. Now the fun part - drawing the actual curves! For a saddle, draw hyperbolic curves that approach along the stable manifold and depart along the unstable one. For nodes, curves come in tangent to the slow eigenvector. For spirals, start with an ellipse and spiral appropriately. For centers, draw concentric ellipses.

Here's a complete example. Consider the system:
ẋ = x + 2y
ẏ = 3x

First, equilibria: x + 2y = 0 and 3x = 0 gives us only (0,0).

Matrix is A = [1, 2; 3, 0]. Calculate det(A) = -6 < 0. It's a saddle!

Eigenvalues: λ² - λ - 6 = 0, so λ = 3 and λ = -2.

For λ = 3: (A - 3I)v = 0 gives us v₁ = (1, 1)ᵀ.
For λ = -2: (A + 2I)v = 0 gives us v₂ = (2, -3)ᵀ.

Draw these eigenvector directions with appropriate arrows. The v₁ direction is unstable (arrows out), v₂ is stable (arrows in).

Now here's a pro tip for checking your work - use nullclines! The x-nullcline is where ẋ = 0, so x + 2y = 0, which is the line y = -x/2. On this line, trajectories move vertically. The y-nullcline is x = 0 (the y-axis), where trajectories move horizontally.

This is huge for Prof. Ditkowski's exams! Nullclines divide the plane into regions where the signs of ẋ and ẏ are constant. In the region where ẋ > 0 and ẏ > 0, trajectories move up and to the right. This helps you check if your arrows are correct!

Common mistakes to avoid - and trust me, these cost points:
1. Wrong arrow directions on eigenvectors. Remember: negative eigenvalue = inward arrows!
2. Trajectories crossing. Never, ever let trajectories cross except at equilibria!
3. Not enough trajectories. Draw at least 4-6 representative curves.
4. Forgetting to indicate rotation direction for spirals and centers.

For spirals, here's a trick: look at the velocity vector at (1, 0). If it points upward, you're going counterclockwise. If downward, clockwise. Always draw the spiral with decreasing radius for stable, increasing for unstable.

Centers are tricky because the ellipses must be nested without touching. Start with one ellipse, then draw others inside and outside. The aspect ratio depends on the eigenvectors of AᵀA.

Special tip for improper nodes: When eigenvalues are repeated with only one eigenvector, every trajectory (except the eigenvector itself) comes in tangent to that eigenvector. Draw the eigenvector first, then add curves that curve in from different directions but all touch the eigenvector line at the origin.

Oh, and here's something Prof. Ditkowski loves to test - degenerate cases! If det(A) = 0, you might have parallel trajectories (one zero eigenvalue) or a whole line of equilibria. For parallel trajectories, they all run parallel to the eigenvector of the non-zero eigenvalue.

Let me give you my secret weapon for exams - the direction field skeleton. Before drawing smooth trajectories, I quickly sketch arrows at about 8-10 points around the origin: (±1, 0), (0, ±1), (±1, ±1), etc. Calculate the velocity vector at each point, draw a small arrow. This gives you a roadmap for your trajectories!

Time management tip: On exams, spend 2 minutes finding equilibria and eigenvalues, 1 minute on eigenvectors, 2 minutes on the actual drawing. Don't over-beautify - accuracy matters more than aesthetics!

Remember, every phase portrait tells a story. Saddles are decision points - small changes lead to completely different futures. Nodes are inevitable outcomes - everything ends up at (or leaves from) the same place. Spirals are damped oscillations. Centers are perpetual motion. Think physically!

One last thing - always, always label your axes and mark the origin clearly. Draw arrowheads on several trajectories to show flow direction. State the classification explicitly: "Unstable saddle" or "Stable spiral." These details matter for full credit!
