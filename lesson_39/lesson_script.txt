Episode 39: 3D Systems and Higher Dimensions**

Audio Lesson Script**

Alright, welcome to Lesson 39 - our final lesson on phase portraits! We're stepping up to 3D and beyond. This is where things get really fascinating but also more challenging to visualize. Prof. Ditkowski usually has one 3D problem on the exam, so let's master this!

So basically, everything we learned about 2D systems extends to 3D, but with some twists. In 3D, we have three eigenvalues, and the combinations give us richer behavior. Think about it - in 2D, trajectories can't cross, so they're pretty constrained. In 3D, trajectories have more room to maneuver around each other!

Here's the key insight: in 3D, eigenvalues still determine everything, but now we can have mixed behaviors. You might have two negative eigenvalues and one positive - that gives you a 2D stable manifold and a 1D unstable manifold. It's like having a plane that attracts and a line that repels!

Let me show you the main 3D equilibrium types. First, if all three eigenvalues are real and negative, you get a stable node - everything converges to the origin. All positive? Unstable node - everything escapes. But here's where it gets interesting: what if you have two negative and one positive eigenvalue? That's a saddle point, but not like 2D saddles!

This 3D saddle has a 2D stable manifold (the eigenspace for the two negative eigenvalues) and a 1D unstable manifold. Picture a plane where trajectories converge, with a line perpendicular to it where they escape. Trajectories spiral down toward the plane, then shoot out along the line!

Now, complex eigenvalues in 3D are super cool. Say you have λ₁ = -1 and λ₂,₃ = -0.5 ± 2i. The complex pair creates rotation in a plane, while the real eigenvalue adds convergence perpendicular to that plane. You get trajectories that spiral inward while also approaching the rotation plane - like water going down a drain!

Here's a concrete example:
```
A = [-1  0   0]
    [ 0 -0.5  2]
    [ 0 -2  -0.5]
```

The eigenvalues are -1 (real) and -0.5 ± 2i (complex pair). This creates a stable spiral-node. Trajectories rotate in the y-z plane while converging along the x-axis. Beautiful!

Let me teach you about projection techniques - this is crucial for visualization. Since we can't really draw in 3D easily, we project onto 2D planes. The three standard projections are:
- x-y plane: set z = 0, see shadow from above
- x-z plane: set y = 0, see shadow from the side
- y-z plane: set x = 0, see shadow from the front

Each projection shows different aspects of the flow. A 3D spiral might look like a 2D spiral in one projection but a node in another!

Poincaré sections are another powerful tool. Instead of looking at the entire 3D flow, we look at where trajectories pierce through a 2D surface. Imagine putting a sheet of paper in your 3D phase space and marking dots where trajectories pass through. The pattern of dots reveals the dynamics!

For example, if trajectories are periodic, you'll see the same points over and over. If they're quasi-periodic, you'll see points filling up curves. And if it's chaotic... well, you'll see a mess that somehow has structure - that's a strange attractor!

Speaking of chaos, here's a preview: the Lorenz system, which Prof. Ditkowski sometimes mentions:
```
ẋ = σ(y - x)
ẏ = rx - y - xz
ż = xy - bz
```

For certain parameter values, this creates the famous butterfly attractor - trajectories that never repeat but stay bounded, creating a fractal structure. Mind-blowing stuff!

Now, let's talk about invariant manifolds in 3D. Remember in 2D, saddles had stable and unstable manifolds along eigenvector directions? In 3D, these can be:
- 1D curves (one real eigenvalue)
- 2D surfaces (two real eigenvalues with same sign)
- 2D spiral surfaces (complex eigenvalue pair)

The stable manifold theorem says trajectories starting on the stable manifold stay on it and approach the equilibrium. Same for unstable manifolds but going backward in time.

Here's an exam tip: Prof. Ditkowski loves asking you to find these manifolds. For a 3D system with eigenvalues λ₁ < 0 < λ₂ < λ₃, the stable manifold is span{v₁} (1D), and the unstable manifold is span{v₂, v₃} (2D). Always state the dimension!

For higher dimensions (4D and beyond), we can't visualize directly, but the math still works! You classify using eigenvalues:
- All Re(λᵢ) < 0: asymptotically stable
- Any Re(λᵢ) > 0: unstable
- All Re(λᵢ) ≤ 0 with some = 0: marginally stable

The dimension of the stable manifold equals the number of eigenvalues with negative real parts. The unstable manifold dimension equals those with positive real parts. The center manifold corresponds to zero real parts.

Numerical tools become essential in higher dimensions. MATLAB, Python, or Mathematica can compute eigenvalues, plot projections, and animate trajectories. But understanding what to look for is key!

Here's a practical approach for 3D problems on exams:
1. Find equilibria (usually just origin for linear systems)
2. Compute all three eigenvalues
3. Classify based on eigenvalue signs and types
4. Identify stable/unstable/center manifold dimensions
5. Describe behavior in words (since drawing is hard)
6. Maybe sketch one or two key projections

Common mistakes in 3D:
- Forgetting that complex eigenvalues come in pairs
- Not stating manifold dimensions
- Trying to draw too much detail
- Missing the third eigenvalue in calculations

Remember, 3D systems can have behaviors impossible in 2D:
- Stable limit cycles attracting nearby trajectories
- Torus attractors (quasi-periodic motion on a donut shape)
- Strange attractors (chaos)
- Homoclinic tangles (really complex stuff)

For Prof. Ditkowski's course, focus on linear 3D systems and their classification. Know how eigenvalues determine stability and manifold dimensions. Be able to describe behavior verbally when drawing isn't feasible.

The big picture: dimensions are just directions in phase space. Whether it's 2D, 3D, or 100D, eigenvalues tell the story. Master the concepts in 2D and 3D, and you'll understand any dimension!
